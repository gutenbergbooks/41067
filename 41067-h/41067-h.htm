<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The first chapter of this volume presents
an introduction to the two
volumes of this series devoted to
Pioneer Roads and Experiences of Travelers.
The evolution of American highways
from Indian trail to macadamized road is
described; the Lancaster Turnpike, the
first macadamized road in the United States,
being taken as typical of roads of the latter
sort.</p>

<p>An experience of a noted traveler,
Francis Baily, the eminent British astronomer,
is presented in chapter two.</p>

<p>The third chapter is devoted to the
story of Zane&rsquo;s Trace from Virginia to
Kentucky across Ohio, and its terminal,
the famous Maysville Pike. It was this
highway which precipitated President Jackson&rsquo;s
veto of the Internal Improvement
Bill of 1830, one of the epoch-making
vetoes in our economic history.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>The last chapter is the vivid picture of
Kentucky travel drawn by Judge James
Hall in his description of &ldquo;The Emigrants,&rdquo;
in <i>Legends of the West</i>.</p>

<p>The illustrations in this volume have
been selected to show styles of pioneer
architecture and means of locomotion,
including types of earliest taverns, bridges,
and vehicles.</p>

<h3>THE EVOLUTION OF HIGHWAYS: FROM INDIAN
TRAIL TO TURNPIKE</h3>


<p>We have considered in this series of
monographs the opening of a number
of Historic Roads and the part
they played in the development of the
most important phases of early American
history. But our attitude has been that
of one asking, Why?&mdash;we have not at
proper length considered all that would be
contained in the question, How? It will
be greatly to our purpose now to inquire
into the methods of road-making, and outline,
briefly, the evolution of the first trodden
paths to the great highways of civilization.</p>

<p>From one aspect, and an instructive one,
the question is one of width; few, if any,
of our roads are longer than those old
&ldquo;threads of soil&rdquo;&mdash;as Holland called the
Indian trails; Braddock&rsquo;s Road was not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>longer than the trail he followed; even the
Cumberland Road could probably have
been followed its entire length by a parallel
Indian path or a buffalo trace. But Braddock&rsquo;s
Road was, in its day, a huge, broad
track, twelve feet wide; and the Cumberland
Road exceeded it in breadth nearly
fifty feet. So our study may be pursued
from the interesting standpoint of a widening
vista; the belt of blue above our heads
grows broader as we study the widening
of the trail of the Indian.</p>

<p>To one who has not followed the trails
of the West or the Northland, the experience
is always delightful. It is much the
same delight as that felt in traversing a
winding woodland road, intensified many
fold. The incessant change of scenery, the
continued surprises, the objects passed
unseen yet not unguessed, those half-seen
through a leafy vista amid the shimmering
green; the pathway just in front very
plain, but twenty feet beyond as absolutely
hidden from your eyes as though it were a
thousand miles away&mdash;such is the romance
of following a trail. One&rsquo;s mind keeps as
active as when looking at Niagara, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
is lulled by the lapsing of those leaves as
if by the roar of that cataract.</p>

<p>Yet the old trail, unlike our most modern
roads, kept to the high ground; even in
low places it seemed to attempt a double-bow
knot in keeping to the points of
highest altitude. But when once on the
hills, the vista presented varied only with
the altitude, save where hidden by the
foliage. We do not choose the old &ldquo;ridge
roads&rdquo; today for the view to be obtained,
and we look continually up while the old-time
traveler so often looked down. As we
have hinted, elsewhere, many of our
pioneer battles&mdash;those old battles of the
trails&mdash;will be better understood when the
position of the attacking armies is understood
to have been on lower levels, the
rifles shooting upward, the enemy often
silhouetted against the very sky-line.</p>

<p>But the one characteristic to which,
ordinarily, there was no exception, was
the narrowness of these ancient routes.
The Indian did not travel in single file
because there was advantage in that formation;
it was because his only routes were
trails which he never widened or improved;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and these would, ordinarily, admit only
of one such person as broke them open.
True, the Indians did have broader trails;
but they were very local in character and
led to maple-sugar orchards or salt wells.
From such points to the Indian villages
there ran what seemed not unlike our
&ldquo;ribbon roads&rdquo;&mdash;the two tracks made by
the &ldquo;travail&rdquo;&mdash;the two poles with crossbar
that dragged on the ground behind the
Indian ponies, upon which a little freight
could be loaded. In certain instances such
roads as these were to be found running between
Indian villages and between villages
and hunting grounds. They were the roads
of times of peace. The war-time trails were
always narrow and usually hard&mdash;the times
of peace came few and far between. As we
have stated, so narrow was the trail, that
the traveler was drenched with water from
the bushes on either hand. And so
&ldquo;blind&rdquo;&mdash;to use a common pioneer word&mdash;were
trails when overgrown, that they
were difficult to find and more difficult to
follow. Though an individual Indian frequently
marked his way through the forest,
for the benefit of others who were to follow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
him or for his own guidance in returning,
the Indian trails in native state were
never blazed. Thus, very narrow, exceedingly
crooked, often overgrown, worn a
foot or more into the ground, lay the
routes on which white men built roads
which have become historic. Let us note
the first steps toward road-building, chronologically.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

<span class="caption">Indian Travail</span>
</div>

<p>The first phase of road-making (if it be
dignified by such a title) was the broadening
of the Indian path by the mere passing
of wider loads over it. The beginning of
the pack-horse era was announced by the
need of greater quantities of merchandise
and provisions in the West to which these
paths led. The heavier the freight tied
on either side of the pack-horse, the more
were the bushes bruised and worn away,
and the more the bed of the trail was
tracked and trampled. The increasing of
the fur-trade with the East at the beginning
of the last half of the eighteenth
century necessitated heavier loads for the
trading ponies both &ldquo;going in&rdquo; and &ldquo;coming
out&rdquo;&mdash;as the pioneers were wont to
say. Up to this time, so far as the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
writer&rsquo;s knowledge goes, the Indian never
lifted a finger to make his paths better in
any one respect; it seems probable that,
oftentimes, when a stream was to be
crossed, which could not be forded, the
Indian bent his steps to the first fallen
tree whose trunk made a natural bridge
across the water. That an Indian never
felled such a tree, it is impossible to say;
but no such incident has come within my
reading. It seems that this must have
happened and perhaps was of frequent
occurrence.</p>

<p>Our first picture, then, of a &ldquo;blind&rdquo;
trail is succeeded by one of a trail made
rougher and a little wider merely by use;
a trail over which perhaps the agents of a
Croghan or a Gist pushed westward with
more and more heavily-loaded pack-horses
than had been customarily seen on the
trails thither. Of course such trails as
began now to have some appearance of
roads were very few. As was true of the
local paths in Massachusetts and Connecticut
and Virginia, so of the long trails into
the interior of the continent, very few
answered all purposes. Probably by 1750<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
three routes, running through southwestern
Pennsylvania, central Pennsylvania, and
central New York, were worn deep and
broad. By broad of course we mean that,
in many places, pack-horses could meet
and pass without serious danger to their
loads. But there were, probably, only
these three which at this time answered
this description. And the wider and the
harder they became, the narrower and
the softer grew scores of lesser trails which
heretofore had been somewhat traversed.
It is not surprising that we find the daring
missionary Zeisberger going to the Allegheny
River like a beast on all fours
through overgrown trails, or that Washington,
floundering in the fall of 1784 along
the upper Monongahela and Cheat Rivers,
was compelled to give up returning to the
South Branch (of the Potomac) by way of
the ancient path from Dunkards Bottom.
&ldquo;As the path it is said is very blind &amp;
exceedingly grown up with briers,&rdquo; wrote
Washington, September 25, 1784, in his
Journal, &ldquo;I resolved to try the other Rout,
along the New Road to Sandy Creek; ...&rdquo;
This offers a signal instance in which an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
ancient route had become obsolete. Yet
the one Washington pursued was not an
Appian Way: &ldquo;... we started at dawning
of day, and passing along a small path
much enclosed with weeds and bushes,
loaded with Water from the overnights
rain &amp; the showers which were continually
falling, we had an uncomfortable
travel....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Such was the &ldquo;New
Road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two great roads opened westward
by the armies of Washington, Braddock,
and Forbes, whose history has been dealt
with at length in this series, were opened
along the line of trails partially widened
by the pack-horses of the Ohio Company&rsquo;s
agents (this course having been first
marked out by Thomas Cresap) and those
of the Pennsylvania traders. Another
route led up the Mohawk, along the wide
Iroquois Trail, and down the Onondaga to
the present Oswego; this was a waterway
route primarily, the two rivers (with the
portage at Rome) offering more or less
facilities for shipping the heavy baggage
by batteaus. It was a portage path from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the Hudson to Lake Ontario; the old landward
trail to Niagara not being opened by
an army.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Yet Braddock&rsquo;s Road, cut in 1755, was
quite filled up with undergrowth in 1758 as
we have noted. It was &ldquo;a brush wood,
by the sprouts from the old stumps.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
In those primeval forests a road narrowed
very fast, and quickly became impassable
if not constantly cared for. The storms of
a single fall or spring month and the heavy
clouds of snow on the trees in winter kept
the ground beneath well littered with
broken limbs and branches. Here and
there great trees were thrown by the winds
across the traveled ways. And so a military
road over which thousands may have
passed would become, if left untouched,
quite as impassable as the blindest trail in a
short time.</p>

<p>Other Indian trails which armies never
traversed became slightly widened by
agents of land companies, as in the case
of Boone blazing his way through Cumber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>land
Gap for Richard Henderson. For a
considerable distance the path was widened,
either by Boone or Martin himself, to Captain
Joseph Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;station&rdquo; in Powell&rsquo;s
Valley. Thousands of traces were widened
by early explorers and settlers who branched
off from main traveled ways, or pushed
ahead on an old buffalo trail; the path just
mentioned, which Washington followed,
was a buffalo trail, but had received the
name of an early pioneer and was known
as &ldquo;McCulloch&rsquo;s Path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But our second picture holds good
through many years&mdash;that trail, even
though armies had passed over it, was still
but a widened trail far down into the early
pioneer days. Though wagons went westward
with Braddock and Forbes, they were
not seen again in the Alleghenies for more
than twenty-five years. These were the
days of the widened trails, the days of the
long strings of jingling ponies bearing
patiently westward salt and powder, bars
of bended iron, and even mill-stones, and
bringing back to the East furs and ginseng.
Of this pack-saddle era&mdash;this age of the
widened trail&mdash;very little has been writ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>ten,
and it cannot be passed here without a
brief description. In Doddridge&rsquo;s <i>Notes</i>
we read: &ldquo;The acquisition of the indispensable
articles of salt, iron, steel and castings
presented great difficulties to the first settlers
of the western country. They had
no stores of any kind, no salt, iron, nor iron
works; nor had they money to make purchases
where these articles could be
obtained. Peltry and furs were their only
resources before they had time to raise cattle
and horses for sale in the Atlantic
states. Every family collected what peltry
and fur they could obtain throughout the
year for the purpose of sending them over
the mountains for barter. In the fall of
the year, after seeding time, every family
formed an association with some of their
neighbors, for starting the little caravan.
A master driver was to be selected from
among them, who was to be assisted by
one or more young men and sometimes a
boy or two. The horses were fitted out
with pack-saddles, to the latter part of
which was fastened a pair of hobbles made
of hickory withes&mdash;a bell and collar ornamented
their necks. The bags provided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
for the conveyance of the salt were filled
with feed for the horses; on the journey a
part of this feed was left at convenient
stages on the way down, to support the
return of the caravan. Large wallets well
filled with bread, jerk, boiled ham, and
cheese furnished provision for the drivers.
At night, after feeding, the horses, whether
put in pasture or turned out into the woods,
were hobbled and the bells were opened
[unstuffed].... Each horse carried
[back] two bushels of alum salt, weighing
eighty-four pounds to the bushel.&rdquo;
Another writer adds: &ldquo;The caravan route
from the Ohio river to Frederick [Maryland]
crossed the stupendous ranges of
the ... mountains.... The path,
<i>scarcely two feet wide</i>, and travelled by
horses in single file, roamed over hill and
dale, through mountain defile, over craggy
steeps, beneath impending rocks, and
around points of dizzy heights, where one
false step might hurl horse and rider into
the abyss below. To prevent such accidents,
the bulky baggage was removed in
passing the dangerous defiles, to secure
the horse from being thrown from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
scanty foothold.... The horses, with
their packs, were marched along in single
file, the foremost led by the leader of the
caravan, while each successive horse was
tethered to the pack-saddle of the horse
before him. A driver followed behind, to
keep an eye upon the proper adjustment of
the packs.&rdquo; The Pennsylvania historian
Rupp informs us that in the Revolutionary
period &ldquo;five hundred pack-horses had been
at one time in Carlisle [Pennsylvania],
going thence to Shippensburg, Fort Loudon,
and further westward, loaded with
merchandise, also salt, iron, &amp;c. The
pack-horses used to carry bars of iron on
their backs, crooked over and around their
bodies; barrels or kegs were hung on each
side of these. Colonel Snyder, of Chambersburg,
in a conversation with the writer
in August, 1845, said that he cleared many a
day from $6 to $8 in crooking or bending
iron and shoeing horses for western carriers
at the time he was carrying on a blacksmith
shop in the town of Chambersburg.
The pack-horses were generally led in
divisions of 12 or 15 horses, carrying about
two hundred weight each ...; when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
bridle road passed along declivities or over
hills, the path was in some places washed
out so deep that the packs or burdens came
in contact with the ground or other impending
obstacles, and were frequently
displaced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though we have been specifically noticing
the Alleghenies we have at the same
time described typical conditions that apply
everywhere. The widened trail was the
same in New England as in Kentucky or
Pennsylvania&mdash;in fact the same, at one
time, in old England as in New England.
Travelers between Glasgow and London as
late as 1739 found no turnpike till within a
hundred miles of the metropolis. Elsewhere
they traversed narrow causeways
with an unmade, soft road on each side.
Strings of pack-horses were occasionally
passed, thirty or forty in a train. The
foremost horse carried a bell so that travelers
in advance would be warned to step
aside and make room. The widened pack-horse
routes were the main traveled ways
of Scotland until a comparatively recent
period. &ldquo;When Lord Herward was sent,
in 1760, from Ayrshire to the college at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Edinburgh, the road was in such a state
that servants were frequently sent forward
with poles to sound the depths of the
mosses and bogs which lay in their way.
The mail was regularly dispatched between
Edinburgh and London, on horseback, and
went in the course of five or six days.&rdquo;
In the sixteenth century carts without
springs could not be taken into the country
from London; it took Queen Henrietta four
days to traverse Watling Street to Dover.
Of one of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s journeys it is
said: &ldquo;It was marvelous for ease and expedition,
for such is the perfect evenness
of the new highway that Her Majesty left
the coach only once, while the hinds and
the folk of baser sort lifted it on their
poles!&rdquo; A traveler in an English coach of
1663 said: &ldquo;This travel hath soe indisposed
mee, yt I am resolved never to ride up
againe in ye coatch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the widened trail or bridle-path, as it
was commonly known in some parts, was
the universal predecessor of the highway.
It needs to be observed, however, that
winter travel in regions where much snow
fell greatly influenced land travel. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
buffalo and Indian did not travel in the
winter, but white men in early days found
it perhaps easier to make a journey on
sleds in the snow than at any other time.
In such seasons the bridle-paths were, of
course, largely followed, especially in the
forests; yet in the open, with the snow a
foot and more in depth, many short cuts
were made along the zig-zag paths and in
numerous instances these short cuts became
the regular routes thereafter for all time.
An interesting instance is found in the
&ldquo;Narrative of Andrew J. Vieau, Sr.:&rdquo;
&ldquo;This path between Green Bay [Wisconsin]
and Milwaukee was originally an
Indian trail, and very crooked; but the
whites would straighten it by cutting across
lots each winter with their jumpers [rude
boxes on runners], wearing bare streaks
through the thin covering [of snow], to be
followed in the summer by foot and horseback
travel along the shortened path.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>This form of traveling was, of course,
unknown save only where snow fell and
remained upon the ground for a considerable
time. Throughout New York State<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
travel on snow was common and in the
central portion of the state, where there
was much wet ground in the olden time,
it was easier to move heavy freight in the
winter than in summer when the soft
ground was treacherous. Even as late as
the building of the Erie Canal in the second
and third decades of the nineteenth century&mdash;long
after the building of the
Genesee Road&mdash;freight was hauled in the
winter in preference to summer. In the
annual report of the comissioners of the
Erie Canal, dated January 25, 1819, we
read that the roads were so wretched
between Utica and Syracuse in the summer
season that contractors who needed to
lay up a supply of tools, provisions,
etc., for their men, at interior points, purchased
them in the winter before and sent
the loads onward to their destinations in
sleighs.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> One of the reasons given by the
Erie Canal commissioners for delays and
increased expenses in the work on the
canal in 1819, in their report delivered to
the legislature February 18, 1820, was that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the absence of snow in central New York in
the winter of 1818-19 prevented the handling
of heavy freight on solid roads; &ldquo;no
hard snow path could be found.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The
soft roads of the summer time were useless
so far as heavy loads of lumber, stone, lime,
and tools were concerned. No winter picture
of early America is so vivid as that
presented by the eccentric Evans of New
Hampshire, who, dressed in his Esquimau
suit, made a midwinter pilgrimage throughout
the country lying south of the Great
Lakes from Albany to Detroit in 1818.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
His experiences in moving across the Middle
West with the blinding storms, the
mountainous drifts of snow, the great icy
cascades, the hurrying rivers, buried out of
sight in their banks of ice and snow, and
the far scattered little settlements lost to
the world, helps one realize what traveling
in winter meant in the days of the pioneer.</p>

<p>The real work of opening roads in
America began, of course, on the bridle-paths
in the Atlantic slope. In 1639 a
measure was passed in the Massachusetts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Bay Colony reading: &ldquo;Whereas the highways
in this jurisdiction have not been laid
out with such conveniency for travellers as
were fit, nor as was intended by this court,
but that in some places they are felt too
straight, and in other places travelers are
forced to go far about, it is therefore,
ordered, that all highways shall be laid out
before the next general court, so as may
be with most ease and safety for travelers;
and for this end every town shall choose
two or three men, who shall join with two
or three of the next town, and these shall
have power to lay out the highways in each
town where they may be most convenient;
and those which are so deputed shall have
power to lay out the highways where they
may be most convenient, notwithstanding
any man&rsquo;s propriety, or any corne ground,
so as it occasion not the pulling down of
any man&rsquo;s house, or laying open any garden
or orchard; and in common [public]
grounds, or where the soil is wet or miry,
they shall lay out the ways the wider, as
six, or eight, or ten rods, or more in common
grounds.&rdquo; With the establishment
of the government in the province of New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
York in 1664 the following regulation for
road-making was established, which also
obtained in Pennsylvania until William
Penn&rsquo;s reign began: &ldquo;In all public works
for the safety and defence of the government,
or the necessary conveniencies of
bridges, highways, and common passengers,
the governor or deputy governor and
council shall send warrents to any justice,
and the justices to the constable of the
next town, or any other town within that
jurisdiction, to send so many laborers and
artificers as the warrent shall direct, which
the constable and two others or more of the
overseers shall forthwith execute, and the
constable and overseers shall have power
to give such wages as they shall judge the
work to deserve, provided that no ordinary
laborer shall be compelled to work from
home above one week together. No man
shall be compelled to do any public work
or service unless the press [impressment]
be grounded upon some known law of this
government, or an act of the governor and
council signifying the necessity thereof, in
both which cases a reasonable allowance
shall be made.&rdquo; A later amendment indi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>cates
the rudeness of these early roads:
&ldquo;The highways to be cleared as followeth,
viz., the way to be made clear of standing
and lying trees, at least ten feet broad; all
stumps and shrubs to be cut close by the
ground. The trees marked yearly on both
sides&mdash;sufficient bridges to be made and
kept over all marshy, swampy, and difficult
dirty places, and whatever else shall be
thought more necessary about the highways
aforesaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, under Penn, the grand
jury laid out the roads, and the courts appointed
overseers and fence-viewers, but in
1692 the townships were given the control
of the roads. Eight years later the county
roads were put in the hands of the county
justices, and king&rsquo;s highways in the hands
of the governor and his council. Each
county was ordered to erect railed bridges
at its expense over rivers, and to appoint
its own overseers and fence-viewers.</p>

<p>Even the slightest mention of these laws
and regulations misrepresents the exact
situation. Up to the time of the Revolutionary
War it can almost be said that nothing
had been done toward what we today<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
know as road-building. Many routes were
cleared of &ldquo;standing and lying trees&rdquo; and
&ldquo;stumps and shrubs&rdquo; were cut &ldquo;close by
the ground&rdquo;&mdash;but this only widened the
path of the Indian and was only a faint
beginning in road-building. The skiff,
batteau, and horse attached to a sleigh or
sled in winter, were the only, common
means of conveying freight or passengers
in the colonies at this period. We have
spoken of the path across the Alleghenies
in 1750 as being but a winding trace; save
for the roughness of the territory traversed
it was a fair road for its day, seek where
the traveler might. In this case, as in so
many others, the history of the postal
service in the United States affords us most
accurate and reliable information concerning
our economic development. In the
year mentioned, 1750, the mail between
New York and Philadelphia was carried
only once a week in summer and twice a
month in winter. Forty years later there
were only eighteen hundred odd miles of
post roads in the whole United States. At
that time (1790) only five mails a week
passed between New York and Philadelphia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be said, loosely, that the widened
trail became a road when wheeled vehicles
began to pass over it. Carts and wagons
were common in the Atlantic seaboard states
as early and earlier than the Revolution.
It was at the close of that war that wagons
began to cross the Alleghenies into the
Mississippi Basin. This first road was a
road in &ldquo;the state of nature.&rdquo; Nothing
had been done to it but clearing it of trees
and stumps.</p>

<p>Yet what a tremendous piece of work
was this. It is more or less difficult for us
to realize just how densely wooded a
country this was from the crest of the Alleghenies
to the seaboard on the east, and
from the mountains to central Indiana and
Kentucky on the west. The pioneers
fought their way westward through wood,
like a bullet crushing through a board.
Every step was retarded by a live, a dying,
or a dead branch. The very trees, as if
dreading the savage attack of the white
man on the splendid forests of the interior,
held out their bony arms and fingers,
catching here a jacket and there a foot, in
the attempt to stay the invasion of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
silent haunts. These forests were very
heavy overhead. The boughs were closely
matted, in a life-and-death struggle for
light and air. The forest vines bound
them yet more inextricably together, until
it was almost impossible to fell a tree with
out first severing the huge arms which
were bound fast to its neighbors. This
dense overgrowth had an important influence
over the pioneer traveler. It made
the space beneath dark; the gloom of a
real forest is never forgotten by the &ldquo;tenderfoot&rdquo;
lumberman. The dense covering
overhead made the forests extremely hot
in the dog days of summer; no one can
appreciate what &ldquo;hot weather&rdquo; means in
a forest where the wind cannot descend
through the trees save those who know our
oldest forests. What made the forests hot
in summer, on the other hand, tended to
protect them from winter winds in cold
weather. Yet, as a rule, there was little
pioneer traveling in the Allegheny forests
in winter. From May until November
came the months of heaviest traffic on the
first widened trails through these gloomy,
heated forest aisles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>It can be believed there was little tree-cutting
on these first pioneer roads. Save
in the laurel regions of the Allegheny and
Cumberland Mountains, where the forest
trees were supplanted by these smaller
growths, there was little undergrowth; the
absence of sunlight occasioned this, and
rendered the old forest more easily traversed
than one would suppose after reading
many accounts of pioneer life. The principal
interruption of travelers on the old
trails was in the form of fallen trees and
dead wood which had been brought to the
ground by the storms. With the exception
of the live trees which were blown over,
these forms of impediment to travel were
not especially menacing; the dead branches
crumbled before an ax. The trees which
were broken down or uprooted by the winds,
however, were obstructions difficult to
remove, and tended to make pioneer roads
crooked, as often perhaps as standing
trees. We can form some practical notion
of the dangerous nature of falling trees by
studying certain of the great improvements
which were early projected in these woods.
The Allegheny Portage Railway over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
mountains of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania,
and the Erie Canal in central New
York, both offer illustrations to the point.
The portage track was sent through an
unbroken, uninhabited forest wilderness
from Hollidaysburg to Johnstown in the
twenties. In order to render the inclines
safe from falling trees and breaking
branches, a swath through the woods was
cut one hundred and twenty feet wide.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The narrow trellis of the inclines scaled
the mountain in the center of this avenue;
wide as it was, a tree fifty feet long could
have swept it away like paper. The Erie
Canal was to be forty feet in width; a clean
sixty foot aisle was opened through the
forests before the digging could begin.</p>

<p>Of course nothing like this could be done
for pioneer highways; when the states
began to appropriate money for state roads,
then the pioneer routes were straightened
by cutting some trees. It was all the scattered
communities could do before this
period to keep the falling trees and
branches from blocking the old roads.
Travelers wound in and out on one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
many tracks, stumbling, slipping, grinding
on the roots, going around great trees
that had not been removed, and keeping to
the high ground when possible, for there
the forest growth was less dense.</p>

<p>The question immediately arises, What
sort of vehicle could weather such roads?
First in the van came the great clumsy
cart, having immensely high and solid
wooden wheels. These were obtained
either by taking a thin slice from the butt
of the greatest log that could be found in
good condition, or by being built piecemeal
by rude carpenters. These great
wheels would go safely wherever oxen
could draw them, many of their hubs being
three feet from the ground. Thus the body
of the cart would clear any ordinary brook
and river at any ford which horses or oxen
could cross. No rocks could severely injure
such a massy vehicle, at the rate it usually
moved, and no mere rut could disturb its
stolid dignity. Like the oxen attached to
it, the pioneer cart went on its lumbering
way despising everything but bogs, great
tree boles and precipices. These creaking
carts could proceed, therefore, nearly on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
ancient bridle-path of the pack-horse age.
On the greater routes westward the introduction
of wheeled vehicles necessitated
some changes; now and then the deep-worn
passage-way was impassable, and
detours were made which, at a later day,
became the main course. Here, where the
widened trail climbed a steeper &ldquo;hog-back&rdquo;
than usual, the cart-drivers made a roundabout
road which was used in dry weather.
There, where the old trail wound about a
marshy piece of ground in all weathers,
the cart-drivers would push on in a straight
line during dry seasons.</p>

<p>Thus the typical pioneer road even before
the day of wagons was a many-track road
and should most frequently be called a
route&mdash;a word we have so frequently used
in this series of monographs. Each of the
few great historic roads was a route which
could have been turned into a three, four,
and five track course in very much the
same way as railways become double-tracked
by uniting a vast number of side-tracks.
The most important reason for
variation of routes was the wet and dry
seasons; in the wet season advantage had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to be taken of every practicable altitude.
The Indian or foot traveler could easily
gain the highest eminence at hand; the
pack-horse could reach many but not all;
the &ldquo;travail&rdquo; and cart could reach many,
while the later wagon could climb only a
few. In dry weather the low ground
offered the easiest and quickest route. As
a consequence every great route had what
might almost be called its &ldquo;wet&rdquo; and
&ldquo;dry&rdquo; roadways. In one of the early laws
quoted we have seen that in wet or miry
ground the roads should be laid out &ldquo;six,
eight, or ten rods [wide],&rdquo; though elsewhere
ten or twelve feet was considered a
fair width for an early road. As a consequence,
even before the day of wagons,
the old routes of travel were often very
wide, especially in wet places; in wet
weather they were broader here than
ever. But until the day of wagons the
track-beds were not so frequently ruined.
Of this it is now time to speak.</p>

<p>By 1785 we may believe the great freight
traffic by means of wagons had fully begun
across the Alleghenies at many points. It
is doubtful if anywhere else in the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
States did &ldquo;wagoning&rdquo; and &ldquo;wagoners&rdquo;
become so common or do such a thriving
trade as on three or four trans-Allegheny
routes between 1785 and 1850. The Atlantic
Ocean and the rivers had been the
arteries of trade between the colonies from
the earliest times. The freight traffic by
land in the seaboard states had amounted
to little save in local cases, compared with
the great industry of &ldquo;freighting&rdquo; which,
about 1785, arose in Baltimore and Philadelphia
and concerned the then Central
West. This study, like that of our postal
history, throws great light on the subject
in hand. Road-building, in the abstract,
began at the centers of population and
spread slowly with the growth of population.
For instance, in Revolutionary days
Philadelphia was, as it were, a hub and
from it a number of important roads, like
spokes, struck out in all directions. Comparatively,
these were few in number and
exceedingly poor, yet they were enough
and sufficiently easy to traverse to give
Washington a deal of trouble in trying to
prevent the avaricious country people from
treacherously feeding the British invaders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>These roads out from Philadelphia, for
instance, were used by wagons longer distances
each year. Beginning back at the
middle of the eighteenth century it may be
said that the wagon roads grew longer and
the pack-horse routes or bridle-paths grew
shorter each year. The freight was brought
from the seaboard cities in wagons to the
end of the wagon roads and there transferred
to the pack-saddles. Referring to
this era we have already quoted a passage
in which it is said that five hundred pack-horses
have been seen at one time at Carlisle,
Pennsylvania. For a longer period
than was perhaps true elsewhere, Carlisle
was the end of the wagon road westward.
A dozen bridle-paths converged here.
Here all freight was transferred to the
strings of patient ponies. Loudon, Pennsylvania,
was another peculiar borderland
depot later on. It will be remembered
that when Richard Henderson and party
advanced to Kentucky in 1775 they were
able to use wagons as far as Captain Joseph
Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;station&rdquo; in Powell&rsquo;s Valley.
At that point all freight had to be transferred
to the backs of ponies for the climb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
over the Cumberlands. In the days of
Marcus Whitman, who opened the first road
across the Rocky Mountains, Fort Laramie,
Wyoming, was the terminus of wagon
travel in the far West. Thus pioneer roads
unfolded, as it were, joint by joint, the
rapidity depending on the volume of traffic,
increase of population, and topography.</p>

<span class="caption">Old Conestoga Freighter</span>
</div>

<p>The first improvement on these greater
routes, after the necessary widening, was
to enable wagons to avoid high ground.
Here and there wagons pushed on beyond
the established limit, and, finding the
way not more desperate than much of the
preceding &ldquo;road,&rdquo; had gone on and on,
until at last wagons came down the western
slopes of the Alleghenies, and wagon
traffic began to be considered possible&mdash;much
to the chagrin of the cursing pack-horse
men. No sooner was this fact accomplished
than some attention was paid to
the road. The wagons could not go everywhere
the ponies or even the heavy carts
had gone. They could not climb the steep
knolls and remain on the rocky ridges.
The lower grounds were, therefore, pursued
and the wet grounds were made passable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
by &ldquo;corduroying&rdquo;&mdash;laying logs closely
together to form a solid roadbed. So far as
I can learn this work was done by everybody
in particular and nobody in general.
Those who were in charge of wagons were,
of course, the most interested in keeping
them from sinking out of sight in the mud-holes.
When possible, such places were
skirted; when high or impassable ground
prevented this, the way was &ldquo;corduroyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have spoken of the width of old-time
bridle-paths; with the advent of the heavy
freighter these wide routes were doubled
and trebled in width. And, so long as the
roadbeds remained in a &ldquo;state of nature,&rdquo;
the heavier the wagon traffic, the wider the
roads became. We have described certain
great tracks, like that of Braddock&rsquo;s Road,
which can be followed today even in the
open by the lasting marks those plunging
freighters made in the soft ground. They
suggest in their deep outline what the old
wagon roads must have been; yet it must
be remembered that only what we may call
the main road is visible today&mdash;the innumerable
side-tracks being obliterated
because not so deeply worn. In a number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of instances on Braddock&rsquo;s Road plain evidence
remains of these side-tracks. Judging
then from this evidence, and from
accounts which have come down to us, the
introduction of the freighter with its
heavier loads and narrower wheels turned
the wide, deeply worn bridle-paths and cart
tracks into far wider and far deeper courses.
The corduroy road had a tendency to contract
the route, but even here, where the
ground was softest, it became desperate
traveling. Where one wagon had gone,
leaving great black ruts behind it, another
wagon would pass with greater difficulty
leaving behind it yet deeper and yet more
treacherous tracks. Heavy rains would fill
each cavity with water, making the road
nothing less than what in Illinois was
known as a &ldquo;sloo.&rdquo; The next wagoner
would, therefore, push his unwilling horses
into a veritable slough, perhaps having
explored it with a pole to see if there was
a bottom to be found there. In some instances
the bottoms &ldquo;fell out,&rdquo; and many
a reckless driver has lost his load in pushing
heedlessly into a bottomless pit. In
case a bottom could be found the driver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
pushes on; if not, he finds a way about; if
this is not possible he throws logs into the
hole and makes an artificial bottom over
which he proceeds.</p>

<p>We can hardly imagine what it meant to
get stalled on one of the old &ldquo;hog wallow&rdquo;
roads on the frontier. True, many of our
country roads today offer bogs quite as
wide and deep as any ever known in western
Virginia or Pennsylvania; and it is
equally true that roads were but little better
in the pioneer era on the outskirts of
Philadelphia and Baltimore than far away
in the mountains. It remains yet for the
present writer to find a sufficiently barbarous
incident to parallel one which
occurred on the Old York (New York)
Road just out of Philadelphia, in which
half a horse&rsquo;s head was pulled off in attempting
to haul a wagon from a hole in
the road. &ldquo;Jonathan Tyson, a farmer of
68 years of age [in 1844], of Abington, saw,
at 16 years of age, much difficulty in going
to the city [Philadelphia on York Road]: a
dreadful mire of blackish mud rested near
the present Rising Sun village.... He
saw there the team of Mr. Nickum, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Chestnut hill, stalled; and in endeavoring
to draw out the forehorse with an iron
chain to his head, it slipped and tore off
the lower jaw, and the horse died on the
spot. There was a very bad piece of road
nearer to the city, along the front of the
Norris estate. It was frequent to see there
horses struggling in mire to their knees.
Mr. Tyson has seen thirteen lime wagons
at a time stopped on the York road, near
Logan&rsquo;s hill, to give one another assistance
to draw through the mire; and the
drivers could be seen with their trowsers
rolled up, and joining team to team to
draw out; at other times they set up a
stake in the middle of the road to warn off
wagons from the quicksand pits. Sometimes
they tore down fences, and made
new roads through the fields.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>If such was the case almost within the
city limits of Philadelphia, it is not difficult
to realize what must have been the
conditions which obtained far out on the
continental routes. It became a serious
problem to get stalled in the mountains
late in the day; assistance was not always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
at hand&mdash;indeed the settlements were
many miles apart in the early days. Many
a driver, however, has been compelled to
wade in, unhitch his horses, and spend the
night by the bog into which his freight
was settling lower and lower each hour.
Fortunate he was if early day brought
assistance. Sometimes it was necessary to
unload wholly or in part, before a heavy
wagon, once fairly &ldquo;set,&rdquo; could be hauled
out. Around such treacherous places ran
a vast number of routes some of which
were as dangerous&mdash;because used once too
often&mdash;as the central track. In some
places detours of miles in length could be
made. A pilot was needed by every inexperienced
person, and many blundering
wiseacres lost their entire stock of worldly
possessions in the old bogs and &ldquo;sloos&rdquo;
and swamps of the &ldquo;West.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A town in Indiana was &ldquo;very appropriately&rdquo;
named Mudholes, a name that
would have been the most common in the
country a century ago if only descriptive
names had been allowed.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The condition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of pioneer roads did, undoubtedly, influence
the beginnings of towns and cities.
On the longer routes it will be found that
the steep hills almost invariably became
the sites of villages because of physical
conditions. &ldquo;Long-a-coming,&rdquo; a New
Jersey village, bore a very appropriate
name.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The girls of Sussex, England, were said
to be exceedingly long-limbed, and a
facetious wag affirmed the reason to be that
the Sussex mud was so deep and sticky
that in drawing out the foot &ldquo;by the
strength of the ancle&rdquo; the muscles, and
then the bones, of the leg were lengthened!
In 1708 when Prince George of Denmark
went to meet Charles the Seventh of Spain
traveling by coach, he traveled at the rate
of nine miles in six hours&mdash;a tribute to
the strength of Sussex mud. Charles
Augustus Murray, in his <i>Travels in North
America</i>, leaves us a humorous account of
the mud-holes in the road from the Potomac
to Fredericksburg, Maryland, and his
experience upon it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 27th of March I quitted Wash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>ington,
to make a short tour in the districts
of Virginia adjacent to the James River;
comprising Richmond, the present capital,
Williamsburgh, the former seat of colonial
government, Norfolk, and other towns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first part of the journey is by
steam-boat, descending the Potomac about
sixty miles. The banks of this river, after
passing Mount Vernon, are uninteresting,
and I did not regret the speed of the
Champion, which performed that distance
in somewhat less than five hours; but this
rate of travelling was amply neutralized by
the movement of the stage which conveyed
me from the landing-place to Fredericsburgh.
I was informed that the distance
was only twelve miles, and I was weak
enough (in spite of my previous experience)
to imagine that two hours would bring me
thither, especially as the stage was drawn
by six good nags, and driven by a lively
cheerful fellow; but the road bade defiance
to all these advantages&mdash;it was, indeed,
such as to compel me to laugh out-right,
notwithstanding the constant and severe
bumping to which it subjected both the intellectual
and sedentary parts of my person.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I had before tasted the sweets of mud-holes,
huge stones, and remnants of pine-trees
standing and cut down; but here was
something new, namely, a bed of reddish-coloured
clay, from one to two feet deep,
so adhesive that the wheels were at times
literally not visible in any one spot from
the box to the tire, and the poor horses&rsquo;
feet sounded, when they drew them out (as
a fellow-traveller observed), like the report
of a pistol. I am sorry that I was not
sufficiently acquainted with chemistry or
mineralogy to analyze that wonderful clay
and state its constituent parts; but if I were
now called upon to give a receipt for a mess
most nearly resembling it, I would write,
&lsquo;Recipe&mdash;(nay, I must write the ingredients
in English, for fear of taxing my Latin
learning too severely)&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether the foregoing, with a proper
admixture of hills, holes, stumps, and
rocks, made a satisfactory <i>draught</i> or not, I
will refer to the unfortunate team&mdash;I, alas!
can answer for the effectual application of
the second part of the prescription, according
to the Joe Miller version of &lsquo;When
taken, to be well shaken!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I arrived, however, without accident or
serious bodily injury, at Fredericsburgh,
having been <i>only</i> three hours and a half in
getting over the said twelve miles; and, in
justice to the driver, I must say that I very
much doubt whether any crack London
whip could have driven those horses over
that ground in the same time: there is not
a sound that can emanate from human
lungs, nor an argument of persuasion that
can touch the feelings of a horse, that he
did not employ, with a perseverance and
success which commanded my admiration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fancy these wild, rough routes which,
combined, often covered half an acre, and
sometimes spread out to a mile in total
width, in freezing weather when every
hub and tuft was as solid as ice. How
many an anxious wagoner has pushed his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
horses to the bitter edge of exhaustion to
gain his destination ere a freeze would stall
him as completely as if his wagon-bed lay
on the surface of a &ldquo;quicksand pit.&rdquo; A
heavy load could not be sent over a frozen
pioneer road without wrecking the vehicle.
Yet in some parts the freight traffic had to
go on in the winter, as the hauling of cotton
to market in the southern states. Such
was the frightful condition of the old roads
that four and five yoke of oxen conveyed
only a ton of cotton so slowly that motion
was almost imperceptible; and in the winter
and spring, it has been said, with perhaps
some tinge of truthfulness, that one
could walk on dead oxen from Jackson to
Vicksburg. The Bull-skin Road of pioneer
days leading from the Pickaway Plains in
Ohio to Detroit was so named from the
large number of cattle which died on the
long, rough route, their hides, to exaggerate
again, lining the way.</p>

<p>In our study of the Ohio River as a
highway it was possible to emphasize the
fact that the evolution of river craft indicated
with great significance the evolution
of social conditions in the region under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
review; the keel-boat meant more than
canoe or pirogue, the barge or flat-boat
more than the keel-boat, the brig and
schooner more than the barge, and the
steamboat far more than all preceding
species. We affirmed that the change of
craft on our rivers was more rapid than on
land, because of the earlier adaptation of
steam to vessels than to vehicles. But it
is in point here to observe that, slow as
were the changes on land, they were
equally significant. The day of the
freighter and the corduroy road was a
brighter day for the expanding nation than
that of the pack-horse and the bridle-path.
The cost of shipping freight by pack-horses
was tremendous. In 1794, during the
Whiskey Insurrection in western Pennsylvania,
the cost of shipping goods to Pittsburg
by wagon ranged from five to ten
dollars per hundred pounds; salt sold for
five dollars a bushel, and iron and steel
from fifteen to twenty cents per pound in
Pittsburg. What must have been the price
when one horse carried only from one
hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty
pounds? The freighter represented a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
growing population and the growing needs
of the new empire in the West.</p>

<p>The advent of the stagecoach marked a
new era as much in advance of the old as
was the day of the steamboat in advance of
that of the barge and brig of early days.</p>

<p>The social disturbance caused by the introduction
of coaches on the pioneer roads
of America gives us a glimpse of road conditions
at this distant day to be gained no
other way. A score of local histories give
incidents showing the anger of those who
had established the more important pack-horse
lines across the continent at the coming
of the stage. Coaches were overturned
and passengers were maltreated; horses
were injured, drivers were chastised and
personal property ruined. Even while the
Cumberland Road was being built the early
coaches were in danger of assault by the
workmen building the road, incited, no
doubt, by the angry pack-horse men whose
profession had been eclipsed. It is interesting
in this connection to look again back
to the mother-country and note the unrest
which was occasioned by the introduction
of stagecoaches on the bridle-paths of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
England. Early coaching there was described
as destructive to trade, prejudicial
to landed interests, destructive to the breed
of horses,<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11*]</a> and as an interference with
public resources. It was urged that travelers
in coaches got listless, &ldquo;not being able
to endure frost, snow or rain, or to lodge
in the fields!&rdquo; Riding in coaches injured
trade since &ldquo;most gentlemen, before they
travelled in coaches, used to ride with
swords, belts, pistols, holsters, portmanteaus,
and hat-cases, which, in these
coaches, they have little or no occasion for:
for, when they rode on horseback, they
rode in one suit and carried another to
wear when they came to their journey&rsquo;s
end, or lay by the way; but in coaches a
silk suit and an Indian gown, with a sash,
silk stockings, and beaver hats, men ride
in and carry no other with them, because
they escape the wet and dirt, which on
horseback they cannot avoid; whereas in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
two or three journeys on horseback, these
clothes and hats were wont to be spoiled;
which done, they were forced to have new
very often, and that increased the consumption
of the manufacturers; which travelling
in coaches doth in no way do.&rdquo; If the
pack-horse man&rsquo;s side of the question was
not advocated with equally marvelous arguments
in America we can be sure there was
no lack of debate on the question whether
the stagecoach was a sign of advancement
or of deterioration. For instance, the mails
could not be carried so rapidly by coach as
by a horseman; and when messages were
of importance in later days they were
always sent by an express rider. The
advent of the wagon and coach promised to
throw hundreds of men out of employment.
Business was vastly facilitated when the
freighter and coach entered the field, but
fewer &ldquo;hands&rdquo; were necessary. Again,
the horses which formerly carried the
freight of America on their backs were not
of proper build and strength to draw heavy
loads on either coach or wagon. They
were ponies; they could carry a few score
pounds with great skill over blind and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
ragged paths, but they could not draw the
heavy wagons. Accordingly hundreds of
owners of pack-horses were doomed to see
an alarming deterioration in the value of
their property when great, fine coach
horses were shipped from distant parts to
carry the freight and passenger loads of the
stagecoach day.</p>

<p>The change in form of American vehicles
was small but their numbers increased
within a few years prodigiously.
Nominally this era must be termed that of
the macadamized road, or roads made of
layers of broken stone like the Cumberland
Road. These roads were wider than any
single track of any of the routes they followed,
though thirty feet was the average
maximum breadth. To a greater degree
than would be surmised, the courses of the
old roads were followed. It has been said
that the Cumberland Road, though paralleling
Braddock&rsquo;s Road from Cumberland
to Laurel Hill, was not built on its bed
more than a mile in the aggregate. After
studying the ground I believe this is more
or less incorrect; for what we should call
Braddock&rsquo;s route was composed of many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
roads and tracks. One of these was a central
road; the Cumberland Road may have
been built on the bed of this central track
only a short distance, but on one of the
almost innumerable side-tracks, detours,
and cut-offs, for many miles. At Great
Meadows, for instance, it would seem that
the Cumberland Road was separated from
Braddock&rsquo;s by the width of the valley; yet
as you move westward you cross the central
track of Braddock&rsquo;s Road just before reaching
Braddock&rsquo;s Grave. May not an old
route have led from Great Meadows thither
on the same hillside where we find the
Cumberland Road today? The crookedness
of these first stable roads, like many
of the older streets in our cities,<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> indicates
that the old corduroy road served in part as
a guide for the later road-makers. It is a
common thing in the mountains, either on
the Cumberland or Pennsylvania state
roads, to hear people say that had the older
routes been even more strictly adhered to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
better grades would have been the result.
A remarkable and truthful instance of this
(for there cannot, in truth, be many) is the
splendid way Braddock&rsquo;s old road sweeps
to the top of Laurel Hill by gaining that
strategic ridge which divides the heads of
certain branches of the Youghiogheny on
the one hand and Cheat River on the other
near Washington&rsquo;s Rock. The Cumberland
Road in the valley gains the same
height (Laurel Hill) by a longer and far
more difficult route.</p>

<p>The stagecoach heralded the new age of
road-building, but these new macadamized
roads were few and far between; many
roadways were widened and graded by
states or counties, but they remained dirt
roads; a few plank roads were built. The
vast number of roads of better grade were
built by one of the host of road and turnpike
companies which sprang up in the first
half of the nineteenth century. Specific
mention of certain of these will be made
later.</p>

<p>Confining our view here to general conditions,
we now see the Indian trail at its
broadest. While the roads, in number,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
kept up with the vast increase of population,
in quality they remained, as a rule,
unchanged. Traveling by stage, except
on the half dozen good roads then in existence,
was, in 1825, far more uncomfortable
than on the bridle-path on horseback half
a century previous. It would be the same
today if we could find a vehicle as inconvenient
as an old-time stagecoach. In our
&ldquo;Experiences of Travelers&rdquo; we shall give
pictures of actual life on these pioneer
roads of early days. A glimpse or two at
these roads will not be out of place here.</p>

<p>The route from Philadelphia to Baltimore
is thus described by the <i>American
Annual Register</i> for 1796: &ldquo;The roads from
Philadelphia to Baltimore exhibit, for the
greater part of the way, an aspect of
savage desolation. Chasms to the depth of
six, eight, or ten feet occur at numerous
intervals. A stagecoach which left Philadelphia
on the 5th of February, 1796, took
five days to go to Baltimore. [Twenty
miles a day]. The weather for the first
four days was good. The roads are in a
fearful condition. Coaches are overturned,
passengers killed, and horses destroyed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the overwork put upon them. In winter
sometimes no stage sets out for two weeks.&rdquo;
Little wonder that in 1800, when President
and Mrs. Adams tried to get to Washington
from Baltimore, they got lost in the
Maryland woods! Harriet Martineau, with
her usual cleverness, thus touches upon our
early roads: &ldquo;... corduroy roads appear
to have made a deep impression on
the imaginations of the English, who seem
to suppose that American roads are all
corduroy. I can assure them that there is
a large variety in American roads. There
are the excellent limestone roads ...
from Nashville, Tennessee, and some like
them in Kentucky.... There is quite
another sort of limestone road in Virginia,
in traversing which the stage is dragged
up from shelf [catch-water] to shelf, some
of the shelves sloping so as to throw the
passengers on one another, on either side
alternately. Then there are the rich mud
roads of Ohio, through whose deep red
sloughs the stage goes slowly sousing
after rain, and gently upsetting when the
rut on one or the other side proves to be
of a greater depth than was anticipated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Then there are the sandy roads of the
pine barrens ... the ridge road, running
parallel with a part of Lake Ontario....
Lastly there is the corduroy
road, happily of rare occurrence, where,
if the driver is merciful to his passengers,
he drives them so as to give them the
association of being on the way to a funeral,
their involuntary sobs on each jolt helping
the resemblance; or, if he be in a hurry,
he shakes them like pills in a pill-box. I
was never upset in a stage but once ...;
and the worse the roads were, the more I
was amused at the variety of devices by
which we got on, through difficulties which
appeared insurmountable, and the more I
was edified at the gentleness with which
our drivers treated female fears and fretfulness.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps it was of the Virginian roads
here mentioned that Thomas Moore wrote:</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Dear George! though every bone is aching,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">After the shaking</span><br />
I&rsquo;ve had this week, over ruts and ridges,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And bridges,</span><br />
Made of a few uneasy planks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">In open ranks</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Over rivers of mud, whose names alone<br />
Would make the knees of stoutest man knock.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><br />
</p>

<p>David Stevenson, an English civil engineer,
leaves this record of a corduroy road
from Lake Erie to Pittsburg: &ldquo;On the
road leading from Pittsburg on the Ohio
to the town of Erie on the lake of that
name, I saw all the varieties of forest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
road-making in great perfection. Sometimes
our way lay for miles through extensive
marshes, which we crossed by corduroy
roads, ...; at others the coach
stuck fast in the mud, from which it could
be extricated only by the combined efforts
of the coachman and passengers; and at
one place we travelled for upwards of a
quarter of a mile through a forest flooded
with water, which stood to the height of
several feet on many of the trees, and
occasionally covered the naves of the coach-wheels.
The distance of the route from
Pittsburg to Erie is 128 miles, which was
accomplished in forty-six hours ... although
the conveyance ... carried the
mail, and stopped only for breakfast, dinner,
and tea, but there was considerable
delay caused by the coach being once upset
and several times mired.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The horrible corduroy roads again made
their appearance,&rdquo; records Captain Basil
Hall, &ldquo;in a more formidable shape, by the
addition of deep, inky holes, which almost
swallowed up the fore wheels of the wagon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and bathed its hinder axle-tree. The jogging
and plunging to which we were now
exposed, and occasionally the bang when
the vehicle reached the bottom of one of
these abysses, were so new and remarkable
that we tried to make a good joke of
them.... I shall not compare this evening&rsquo;s
drive to trotting up or down a pair of
stairs, for, in that case, there would be
some kind of regularity in the development
of the bumps, but with us there was no
wavering, no pause, and when we least
expected a jolt, down we went, smack!
dash! crash! forging, like a ship in a
head-sea, right into a hole half a yard
deep. At other times, when an ominous
break in the road seemed to indicate the
coming mischief, and we clung, grinning
like grim death, to the railing at the sides
of the wagon, expecting a concussion which
in the next instant was to dislocate half
the joints in our bodies, down we sank
into a bed of mud, as softly as if the bottom
and sides had been padded for our
express accommodation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first and most interesting macadam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>ized
road in the United States was the old
Lancaster Turnpike, running from Philadelphia
to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Its
position among American roads is such that
it deserves more than a mere mention.
It has had several historians, as it well
deserves, to whose accounts we are largely
indebted for much of our information.<a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The charter name of this road was &ldquo;The
Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike Road
Company;&rdquo; it was granted April 9, 1792,
and the work of building immediately
began. The road was completed in 1794
at a cost of four hundred and sixty-five
thousand dollars. When the subscription
books were opened there was a tremendous
rush to take the stock. The money raised
for constructing and equipping this ancient
highway with toll houses and bridges, as
well as grading and macadamizing it, was
by this sale of stock. In the Lancaster
<i>Journal</i> of Friday, February 5, 1796, the
following notice appeared:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That agreeable to a by-law of stockholders,
subscriptions will be opened at the
Company&rsquo;s office in Philadelphia on Wednesday,
the tenth of February next, for
one hundred additional shares of capital
stock in said company. The sum to be
demanded for each share will be $300,
with interest at six per cent. on the different
instalments from the time they are severally
called for, to be paid by original stockholders;
one hundred dollars thereof to be
paid at time of subscribing, and the remainder
in three equal payments, at 30, 60
and 90 days, no person to be admitted to
subscribe more than one share on the
same day.</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>
By order of the Board. &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
<span class="smcap">William Govett</span>, &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
Secretary.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>

<p>&ldquo;When location was fully determined
upon,&rdquo; writes Mr. Witmer, &ldquo;as you will
observe, today, a more direct line could
scarcely have been selected. Many of the
curves which are found at the present time
did not exist at that day, for it has been
crowded and twisted by various improvements
along its borders so that the original<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
constructors are not responsible. So
straight, indeed, was it from initial to
terminal point that it was remarked by one
of the engineers of the state railroad, constructed
in 1834 (and now known as the
Pennsylvania Railroad), that it was with
the greatest difficulty that they kept their
line off of the turnpike, and the subsequent
experiences of the engineers of the same
company verify the fact, as you will see.
Today there is a tendency, wherever the
line is straightened, to draw nearer to this
old highway, paralleling it in many places
for quite a distance, and as it approaches
the city of Philadelphia, in one or two
instances they have occupied the old road
bed entirely, quietly crowding its old rival
to a side, and crossing and recrossing it in
many places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will often wonder as you pass over
this highway, remembering the often-stated
fact by some ancient wagoner or
stage-driver (who today is scarcely to be
found, most of them having thrown down
the reins and put up for the night), that at
that time there were almost continuous
lines of Conestoga wagons, with their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
feed troughs suspended at the rear and the
tar can swinging underneath, toiling up
the long hills (for you will observe there
was very little grading done when that
roadway was constructed), and you wonder
how it was possible to accommodate so
much traffic as there was, in addition to
stagecoaches and private conveyances,
winding in and out among these long lines
of wagons. But you must bear in mind
that the roadway was very different then
from what it is at the present time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The narrow, macadamized surface,
with its long grassy slope (the delight of
the tramp and itinerant merchant, especially
when a neighboring tree casts a cooling
shadow over its surface), which same slope
becomes a menace to belated and unfamiliar
travelers on a dark night, threatening them
with an overturn into what of more recent
times is known as the Summer road, did
not exist at that time, but the road had a
regular slope from side ditch to center, as
all good roads should have, and conveyances
could pass anywhere from side to
side. The macadam was carefully broken
and no stone was allowed to be placed on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the road that would not pass through a
two-inch ring. A test was made which
can be seen today about six miles east of
Lancaster, where the roadway was regularly
paved for a distance of one hundred feet
from side to side, with a view of constructing
the entire line in that way. But it
proved too expensive, and was abandoned.
Day, in his history, published in 1843,<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
makes mention of the whole roadway having
been so constructed, but I think that
must have been an error, as this is the
only point where there is any appearance
of this having been attempted, and can be
seen at the present time when the upper
surface has been worn off by the passing
and repassing over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The placing of tollgates on the Lancaster
Pike is thus announced in the Lancaster
<i>Journal</i>, previously mentioned, where
the following notice appears:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The public are hereby informed that
the President and Managers of the Philadelphia
and Lancaster Turnpike Road having
perfected the very arduous and import<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>ant
work entrusted by the stockholders to
their direction, have established toll gates at
the following places on said road, and have
appointed a toll gatherer at each gate, and
that the rates of toll to be collected at the
several gates are by resolution of the
Board and agreeable to Act of Assembly
fixed and established as below. The total
distance from Lancaster to Philadelphia is
62 miles.</p>

<p>There were regular warehouses or freight
stations in the various towns through which
the Lancaster Pike passed, Mr. Witmer
leaves record, where experienced loaders
or packers were to be found who attended
to filling these great curving wagons,
which were elevated at each end and depressed
in the centre; and it was quite an
art to be able to so pack them with the
various kinds of merchandise that they
would carry safely, and at the same time
to economize all the room necessary; and
when fully loaded and ready for the journey
it was no unusual case for the driver to be
appealed to by some one who wished to
follow Horace Greeley&rsquo;s advice and &ldquo;go
west,&rdquo; for permission to accompany him
and earn a seat on the load, as well as
share his mattress on the barroom floor at
night by tending the lock or brake. Mr.
Witmer was told by one of the largest and
wealthiest iron masters of Pittsburg that
his first advent to the Smoky City was on a
load of salt in that capacity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In regard to the freight or transportation
companies,&rdquo; continues the annalist,
&ldquo;the Line Wagon Company was the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
prominent. Stationed along this highway
at designated points were drivers and horses,
and it was their duty to be ready as soon
as a wagon was delivered at the beginning
of their section to use all despatch in forwarding
it to the next one, thereby losing
no time required to rest horses and driver,
which would be required when the same
driver and horses took charge of it all the
way through. But, like many similar
schemes, what appeared practical in theory
did not work well in practice. Soon the
wagons were neglected, each section caring
only to deliver it to the one succeeding,
caring little as to its condition, and soon the
roadside was encumbered with wrecks and
breakdowns and the driver and horses
passed to and fro without any wagon or
freight from terminal points of their sections,
leaving the wagons and freight to be
cared for by others more anxious for its
removal than those directly in charge. So
it was deemed best to return to the old system
of making each driver responsible for
his own wagon and outfit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wagoner, next to a stagecoach-driver,
was a man of immense importance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and they were inclined to be clannish.
They would not hesitate to unite against
landlord, stage-driver or coachman who
might cross their path, as in a case when a
wedding party was on its way to Philadelphia,
which consisted of several gigs.
These were two-wheeled conveyances, very
similar to our road-carts of the present
day, except that they were much higher
and had large loop springs in the rear just
back of the seat; they were the fashionable
conveyance of that day. When one of the
gentlemen drivers, the foremost one (possibly
the groom), was paying more attention
to his fair companion than his horses, he
drove against the leaders of one of the
numerous wagons that were passing on in
the same direction. It was an unpardonable
offense and nothing short of an encounter
in the stable yard or in front of the
hotel could atone for such a breach of highway
ethics. At a point where the party
stopped to rest before continuing their
journey the wagoners overtook them and
they immediately called on the gentleman
for redress. But seeing a friend in the
party they claimed they would excuse the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
culprit on his friend&rsquo;s account; the offending
party would not have it so, and said
no friend of his should excuse him from
getting a beating if he deserved it, and I
have no doubt he prided himself on his
muscular abilities also. However it was
peaceably arranged and each pursued his
way without any blood being shed or bones
broken. That was one of the many similar
occurrences which happened daily,
many not ending so harmlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stage lines were not only the
means of conveying the mails and passengers,
but of also disseminating the news of
great events along the line as they passed.
The writer remembers hearing it stated
that the stage came through from Philadelphia
with a wide band of white muslin
bound around the top, and in large letters
was the announcement that peace had been
declared, which was the closing of the
second war with Great Britain, known as
the War of 1812. What rejoicing it caused
along the way as it passed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The taverns of this old turnpike were
typical. Of them Mr. Moore writes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Independent of the heavy freighting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
numerous stage lines were organized for
carrying passengers. As a result of this
immense traffic, hotels sprung up all along
the road, where relays of horses were kept,
and where passengers were supplied with
meals. Here, too, the teamsters found
lodging and their animals were housed and
cared for over night. The names of these
hotels were characteristic of the times.
Many were called after men who had borne
conspicuous parts in the Revolutionary
War that had just closed&mdash;such as Washington,
Warren, Lafayette, and Wayne,
while others represented the White and
Black Horse, the Lion, Swan, Cross Keys,
Ship, etc. They became favorite resorts
for citizens of their respective neighborhoods,
who wished at times to escape from
the drudge and ennui of their rural homes
and gaze upon the world as represented by
the dashing stages and long lines of Conestoga
wagons. Here neighbor met neighbor&mdash;it
was the little sphere in which
they all moved, lived and had their being.
They sipped their whisky toddies together,
which were dispensed at the rate of three
cents a single glass, or for a finer quality,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
five for a Spanish quarter, with the landlord
in, was asked; smoked cigars that
were retailed four for a cent&mdash;discussed
their home affairs, including politics, religion
and other questions of the day, and
came just as near settling them, as the
present generation of men, that are filling
their places, required large supplies and
made convenient home markets for the sale
of butter, eggs, and whatever else the
farmers had to dispose of.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">Earliest Style of Log Tavern</span>
</div>

<p>In our history of the Cumberland Road
the difference between a wagonhouse and
a tavern was emphasized. Mr. Witmer
gives an incident on the Lancaster Turnpike
which presents vividly the social
position of these two houses of entertainment:
&ldquo;It was considered a lasting disgrace
for one of the stage taverns to entertain
a wagoner and it was sure to lose the
patronage of the better class of travel,
should this become known. The following
instance will show how carefully the line
was drawn. In the writer&rsquo;s native village,
about ten miles east of this city [Lancaster],
when the traffic was unusually heavy
and all the wagon taverns were full, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
wagoner applied to the proprietor of the
stage hotel for shelter and refreshment,
and after a great deal of consideration on
his part and persuasion on the part of the
wagoner he consented, provided the guest
would take his departure early in the morning,
before there was any likelihood of any
aristocratic arrivals, or the time for the
stage to arrive at this point. As soon as
he had taken his departure the hostlers
and stable boys were put to work to clean
up every vestige of straw or litter in front
of the hotel that would be an indication of
having entertained a wagoner over night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The later history of the turnpike has
been sketched by Mr. Moore as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The turnpike company had enjoyed an
uninterrupted era of prosperity for more
than twenty-five years. During this time
the dividends paid had been liberal&mdash;sometimes,
it is said, exceeding fifteen per cent
of the capital invested. But at the end of
that time the parasite that destroys was
gradually being developed. Another, and
altogether new system of transportation
had been invented&mdash;a railroad&mdash;and which
had already achieved partial success in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
some places in Europe. It was about the
year 1820 that this new method of transportation
began to claim the serious attention
of the progressive business men
throughout the state. The feeling that
some better system than the one in use
must be found was fed and intensified by
the fact that New York State was then
constructing a canal from Albany to the
lakes; that when completed it would give
the business men of New York City an
unbroken water route to the west....</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the completion of the entire
Pennsylvania canal system to Pittsburg,
in 1834, the occupation of the famous old
Conestoga teams was gone.<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The same
may also be said of the numerous lines of
the stages that daily wended their way over
the turnpike. The changes wrought were
almost magical. Everyone who rode patronized
the cars; and the freight was also
forwarded by rail. The farmers, however,
were not ruined as they had maintained
they would be. Their horses, as well as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
drivers, were at once taken into the railway
service and employed in drawing cars from
one place to another. It was simply a
change of vocation, and there still remained
a market for grain, hay, straw and other
produce of the farm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The loss sustained by the holders of
turnpike stock, however, was immeasurable.
In a comparative sense, travel over
the turnpike road was suspended. Receipts
from tolls became very light and the dividends,
when paid, were not only quite
diminutive, but very far between.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The officers of the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company have always been noted for
their foresight, as well as shrewdness in
protecting the business interests of their
organization&mdash;and none have given more
substantial evidence of these traits than its
present chief officer, Mr. Alexander Cassatt.
In the year 1876 the horse cars had been
extended as far west as the Centennial
buildings and it became apparent in a year
or two thereafter that they might be still
further extended over the turnpike in the
direction of Paoli and thus become an
annoying competitor for the local travel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
which had been carefully nurtured and
built up by the efforts of the railroad company.
Under the leadership of Mr. Cassatt
a company was organized to purchase
the road. When all the preliminaries had
been arranged a meeting of the subscribers
to the purchasing fund was held on the
twentieth day of April, 1880. The turnpike
was purchased from Fifty-second
Street to Paoli, about seventeen miles, for
the sum of twenty thousand dollars. In the
following June a charter was secured for
the &lsquo;Lancaster Avenue Improvement Company,&rsquo;
and Mr. Cassatt was chosen president.
The horse railroad was thus shut off
from a further extension over the old turnpike.
The new purchasers rebuilt the entire
seventeen miles and there is today
probably no better macadam road in the
United States, nor one more scrupulously
maintained than by &lsquo;The Lancaster Avenue
Improvement Company.&rsquo; Some parts of
the turnpike road finally became so much
out of repair that the traveling public
refused to longer pay the tolls demanded.
This was the case on that portion of the
road lying between Paoli and Exton, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
distance of some eight and a half miles.
It traversed parts of the townships of
Willistown and East and West Whiteland,
in Chester County and upon notice of abandonment
being served in 1880 upon the
supervisors of these townships, those officials
assumed the future care of the road. The
turnpike was also abandoned from the
borough of Coatesville to the Lancaster
County line, a distance of about eight and
one-half miles. This left only that portion
of the turnpike lying between Exton station
and the borough of Coatesville, a distance
of some ten miles, under control of the old
company, and upon which tollgates were
maintained. The road was in a wretched
repair and many persons driving over it
refused to pay when tolls were demanded.
The company, however, continued to employ
collectors and gather shekels from
those who were willing to pay and suffering
those to pass who refused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus the old company worried along
and maintained its organization until 1899,
when the &lsquo;Philadelphia and West Chester
Traction Company,&rsquo; made its appearance.
This company thought it saw an oppor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>tunity
to extend the railroad west over the
turnpike at least as far as Downingtown, and
possibly as far as the borough of Coatesville.
Terms were finally agreed upon
with the president of the Turnpike Company,
and all the rights, titles and interests
in the road then held by the original Turnpike
Company, and which embraced that
portion lying between Exton and the
borough of Coatesville, were transferred to
Mr. A. M. Taylor, as trustee, for ten dollars
per share. The original issue was twelve
hundred shares. It was estimated that at
least two hundred shares would not materialize,
being either lost or kept as
souvenirs. The length of the road secured
was about ten miles. The disposition of
the old road may be enumerated as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The distance from Coatesville to Philadelphia,
via Whitford, a station on the
Pennsylvania Railroad ten miles east of
Coatesville, thence to West Chester and
over the electric road, is somewhat less than
by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Immediately
after the purchase, Mr. Taylor announced
that it was the intention of his
company to extend their road to Downingtown,
and, possibly, to Coatesville. But a
charter for a trolley road does not carry
with it the right of eminent domain. Upon
investigation, Mr. Taylor discovered that
the Pennsylvania Railroad Company owned
property on both sides of the purchased
turnpike, and that without the consent of
that organization a trolley road could not
be laid over the turnpike. He further
discovered that at a point west of Downingtown
the railroad company, in connection
with one of its employees, owned a strip
of land extending from the Valley Hill on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the north to the Valley Hill on the south.
The proposed extension of the trolley
road, therefore, had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the turnpike road could not be used
by the new purchasers for the purposes intended,
it was a useless and annoying piece
of property in their hands. A petition has
already [1901] been filed in the Court of
Quarter Sessions of Chester County looking
toward having the road condemned.
Judge Hemphill has appointed jurors to
view the said turnpike road and fix the
damages that may be due the present
owners. Whatever damages may finally
be agreed upon the county of Chester must
pay, and the supervisors of the different
townships through which the road passes
will thereafter assume its care. This will
probably be the last official act in which
the title of the old organization will participate.
&lsquo;Men may come and men may go,&rsquo;
and changes be made both in ownership
and purposes of use, but whatever the
future may have in store for this grand
old public highway, the basic principle
will always be: &lsquo;The Old Philadelphia and
Lancaster Turnpike;&rsquo; and as such forever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
remain a lasting monument to the courageous,
progressive, and patriotic men whose
capital entered into and made its construction
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The principal rivals of the macadamized
roads were the plank roads. The first
plank road in America was built at Toronto,
Canada, in 1835-36, during Sir Francis
Bond Head&rsquo;s governorship. It was an
experiment and one Darcy Boulton is said
to have been the originator of the plan.<a name="FNanchor_181_20" id="FNanchor_181_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_20" class="fnanchor">[18*]</a></p>

<p>In 1837 this method of road-building was
introduced into the United States, Syracuse,
New York, possessing the first plank road
this side the Canadian border. In fifteen
years there were two thousand one hundred
and six miles of these roads in New York
State alone, and the system had spread
widely through the more prosperous and
energetic states. Usually these roads were
single-track, the track being built on the
left hand side of the roadway; the latter
became known as the &ldquo;turn-out.&rdquo; The
planks, measuring eight inches by three,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
were laid on stringers, these, in turn, resting
on a more or less elaborately made bed.
The average cost of plank roads in New
York was a trifle less than two thousand
dollars per mile. It will be remembered
that the Cumberland Road cost on the
average over ten thousand dollars per mile
in Maryland and Pennsylvania, and three
thousand four hundred dollars per mile
west of the Ohio River. Its estimated cost
per mile, without bridging, was six thousand
dollars. It was natural, therefore,
that plank roads should become popular&mdash;for
the country was still a &ldquo;wooden
country,&rdquo; as the pioneers said. It was
argued that the cost was &ldquo;infinitely
less&mdash;that it [plank road] is easier for
the horse to draw upon&mdash;and that such a
road costs less for repairs and is more durable
than a Macadam road.... On the
Salina and Central road, a few weeks back,
for a wager, a team [two horses] brought
in, without any extraordinary strain, six
tons of iron from Brewerton, a distance of
twelve miles, to Syracuse [New York]....
Indeed, the farmer does not seem to make
any calculations of the weight taken. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
loads his wagon as best he can, and the
only care is not to exceed the quantity
which it will carry; whether the team can
draw the load, is not a consideration....&rdquo;
Such arguments prevailed in the day when
timber was considered almost a nuisance,
and plank roads spread far and wide.</p>

<p>Few who were acquainted with primitive
conditions have left us anything vivid in
the way of descriptions of roads and road-making.
&ldquo;The pioneers of our State,&rdquo;
wrote Calvin Fletcher, in an exceedingly
interesting paper read before the Indiana
Centennial Association, July 4, 1900, &ldquo;found
Indian trails, which, with widening, proved
easy lines of travel. Many of these afterward
became fixtures through use, improvement,
and legislation.... Next to the
hearty handshake and ready lift at the
handspike, where neighbors swapped work
at log-rollings, was the greeting when, at
fixed periods, all able-bodied men met to
open up or work upon the roads. My child-feet
pattered along many of the well-constructed
thoroughfares of today when they
were only indistinct tracings&mdash;long lines
of deadened trees, deep-worn horse paths,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and serpentine tracks of wabbling wagon
wheels. The ever-recurring road-working
days and their cheerful observance, with
time&rsquo;s work in rotting and fire&rsquo;s work in
removing dead tree and stump, at last let in
long lines of sunshine to dry up the mud,
to burn up the miasma, and to bless the
wayfarer to other parts, as well as to disclose
what these pioneer road-makers had
done for themselves by opening up fields in
the forests.... To perfect easily and
naturally these industries requires three
generations. The forests must be felled,
logs rolled and burned, families reared,
and in most cases the land to be paid for.
When this is accomplished a faithful picture
would reveal not only the changes
that had been wrought, but a host of
prematurely broken down men and women,
besides an undue proportion resting peacefully
in country graveyards. A second
generation straightens out the fields at odd
corners, pulls the stumps, drains the wet
spots, and casting aside the sickle of their
father, swings the cradle over broader
fields; and even trenches upon the plans of
the third generation by pushing the claim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of the reaper, the mower and the
thresher.... The labor of the three
generations in road-making I class as follows:
To the first generation belonged
locating the roads and the clearing the timber
from them. The wet places would
become miry and were repaired by the use
of logs.... The roots and stumps caused
many holes, called chuck holes, which
were repaired by using brush and dirt&mdash;with
the uniform result that at each end of
the corduroy or brush repairs, a new mud
or chuck hole would be formed in time;
and thus until timber and brush became
exhausted did the pioneer pave the way
for the public and himself to market, to
court, and to elections. The second generation
discovered a value in the inexhaustible
beds of gravel in the rivers and
creeks, as well as beneath the soil.
Roadbeds were thrown up, and the side
ditches thus formed contributed to sound
wheeling. Legislation tempted capital to
invest and tollgates sprang up until the third
generation removed them and assumed the
burden of large expenditures from public
funds for public benefit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And thus have passed away the nightmare
of the farmer, the traveller, the
mover and the mail-carrier&mdash;a nightmare
that prevailed nine months of the year....
An experience of a trip from Indianapolis
to Chicago in March, 1848, by mail stage
is pertinent. It took the first twenty-four
hours to reach Kirklin, in Boone County;
the next twenty-four to Logansport, the
next thirty-six to reach South Bend. A
rest then of twenty-four hours on account
of high water ahead; then thirty-six hours
to Chicago&mdash;five days of hard travel in
mud or on corduroy, or sand.... In
the summer passenger coaches went
through, but when wet weather came the
mud wagon was used to carry passengers
and mail, and when the mud became too
deep the mail was piled into crates, canvas-covered,
and hauled through. This was
done also on the National [Cumberland],
the Madison, the Cincinnati, the Lafayette
and the Bloomington Roads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>corv&eacute;e</i>, or required work on the
roads of France, has been given as one of
the minor causes of the social unrest which
reached its climax in the French Revolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>tion.
American peasants had no such hardship
according to an anonymous rhymester:</p>

<p class="poem">
Oh, our life was tough and tearful, and its toil was often fearful,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And often we grew faint beneath the load.</span><br />
But there came a glad vacation and a sweet alleviation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When we used to work our tax out on the road.</span><br />
<br />
When we used to work our tax out, then we felt the joys of leisure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And we felt no more the prick of labor&rsquo;s goad;</span><br />
Then we shared the golden treasure of sweet rest in fullest measure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When we used to work our tax out on the road.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The macadam and plank roads saw the
Indian trail at its widest and best. The
railway has had a tendency to undo even
such advances over pioneer roads as came
in the heyday of macadam and plank roads.
We have been going backward since 1840
rather than forward. The writer has had
long acquaintance with what was, in 1830,
the first turnpike in Ohio&mdash;the Warren
and Ashtabula Road; it was probably a far
better route in 1830 than in 1900. By
worrying the horse you can not make more
than four miles an hour over many parts
of it. One ought to go into training preparatory
to a carriage drive over either the
Cumberland or the Pennsylvania road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
across the Alleghenies. As the trail was
widened it grew better, but once at its
maximum width it was eclipsed as an
avenue by the railway and, exceptions
aside, has since 1850 deteriorated. Every
foot added in width, however, has contained
a lesson in American history; every road,
as we have said, indicates a need; and the
wider the road, it may be added, the
greater the need. An expanding nation,
in a moment&rsquo;s time, burst westward through
these narrow trails, and left them standing
as open roadways. Few material objects
today suggest to our eyes this marvelous
movement. These old routes with their
many winding tracks, the ponderous
bridges and sagging mile-posts,<a name="FNanchor_19_21" id="FNanchor_19_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_21" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> are relics
of those momentous days.</p>

<h3>A PILGRIM ON THE PENNSYLVANIA ROAD</h3>


<p>The following chapter is from Francis
Baily&rsquo;s volume, <i>A Journal of a Tour
in Unsettled Parts of North America</i>.
It is an account of a journey in 1796 from
Philadelphia to Pittsburg over the Pennsylvania
road treated of in Volume V of
this series. Francis Baily was an English
scientist of very great reputation. It is to
be doubted whether there is another
account of a journey as far west as Mr.
Baily&rsquo;s record takes us (Cincinnati, Ohio)
written at so early a date by an equally
famous foreign scholar and scientist.</p>

<p>The route pursued was the old state road
begun in 1785 running through Pennsylvania
from Chambersburg, Bedford, and
Greensburg to Pittsburg. Mr. Baily&rsquo;s
itinerary is by ancient taverns, most of
which have passed from recollection.</p>

<p>From Pittsburg he went with a company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
of pioneers down the Ohio River to their
new settlement near Cincinnati. In his
experiences with these friends he gives us
a vivid picture of pioneer travel north of
the Ohio River.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There being no turnpikes in America,
the roads are, of course, very bad in winter,
though excellent in summer. I waited
at Baltimore near a week before I could
proceed on my journey, the roads being
rendered impassable. There is, at present,
but one turnpike-road on the continent,
which is between Lancaster and Philadelphia,<a name="FNanchor_20_22" id="FNanchor_20_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_22" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
a distance of sixty-six miles, and is
a masterpiece of its kind; it is paved with
stone the whole way, and overlaid with
gravel, so that it is never obstructed during
the most severe season. This practice is
going to be adopted in other parts of that
public-spirited state [Pennsylvania], though
none of the other states have yet come
into the measure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Baltimore to Philadelphia are
ninety-eight miles; between which places
there is no want of conveyance, as there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
three or four stages run daily. In one of
these I placed myself on the morning of
<i>March 3rd, 1796</i>. A description of them
perhaps would be amusing. The body of
the carriage is closed in, about breast high;
from the sides of which are raised six or
eight small perpendicular posts, which
support a covering&mdash;so that it is in fact a
kind of open coach. From the top are
suspended leather curtains, which may be
either drawn up in fine weather, or let
down in rainy or cold weather; and which
button at the bottom. The inside is fitted
up with four seats, placed one before the
other; so that the whole of the passengers
face the horses; each seat will contain
three passengers; and the driver sits on
the foremost, under the same cover with
the rest of the company. The whole is
suspended on springs; and the way to get
into it is <i>in front</i>, as if you were getting
into a covered cart. This mode of travelling,
and which is the only one used in
America, is very pleasant as you enjoy the
country much more agreeably than when
imprisoned in a close coach, inhaling and
exhaling the same air a thousand times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
over, like a cow chewing the cud; but then
it is not quite so desirable in disagreeable
weather.<a name="FNanchor_21_23" id="FNanchor_21_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_23" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;We had not proceeded far on our
journey before we began to encounter
some of those inconveniences to which
every person who travels in this country <i>in
winter time</i> is exposed. The roads, which
in general were very bad, would in some
places be impassable, so that we were
obliged to get out and walk a considerable
distance, and sometimes to &lsquo;put our
shoulders to the wheel;&rsquo; and this in the
most unpleasant weather, as well as in the
midst of mire and dirt. However, we did
manage to get twelve miles to breakfast;
and after that, to a little place called Bush,
about thirteen miles farther, to dinner; and
about nine o&rsquo;clock at night we came to
<i>Havre de Grace</i>, about twelve miles further,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
to supper; having walked nearly half the
way up to our ancles in mud, in a most
inclement season. Havre de Grace is a
pretty little place, most delightfully situated
on the banks of the Susquehannah
river, which at this place is about a quarter
of a mile broad; it is about a couple of
miles above the mouth of the river, where
it empties into the Chesapeak Bay; a fine
view of which you have from the town.
An excellent tavern is kept here by Mr.
Barney ... and which is frequented
by parties in the shooting season, for the
sake of the wild fowl with which the
Susquehannah so plentifully abounds; the
canvass-back, a most delicious bird, frequents
this river.... Next morning we
got ferried across the river, and, breakfasting
at the tavern on the other side, proceeded
on our journey, encountering the
same difficulties we had done the preceding
day. About three miles from Barney&rsquo;s
is a little place, called Principio, situated
in a highly romantic country, where there
is a large foundry for cannon and works
for boring them, situated in a valley surrounded
by a heap of rocks; the wheels of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the works are turned by a stream of water
running over some of these precipices.
About three miles from this is another
delightful place, called Charleston; I mean
with respect to its <i>situation</i>; as to the town
itself, it does not seem to improve at all,
at which I very much wonder, as it is most
advantageously situated at the head of the
Chesapeak, of which and the country
adjoining it commands a full and most
charming view. We got about nine miles
farther, to a town called Elkton, to dinner.
This place has nothing in it to attract the
attention of travellers. I shall therefore
pass it by, to inform you that we intended
getting to Newport, about eighteen miles,
to sleep. It was four o&rsquo;clock before we
started; and we had not proceeded far on
these miserable roads, ere night overtook
us; and, as the fates would have it, our
unlucky coachman drove us into a miry
bog; and, in spite of all our endeavours,
we could not get the coach out again; we
were therefore obliged to <i>leave it there, with
the whole of the baggage, all night</i>; and were
driven to the necessity of seeking our way
in the dark to the nearest house, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
was about a mile and a half off; there,
getting ourselves cleaned and a good supper,
we went to bed. Next morning we
found everything just as we left it; and,
getting another coach, we proceeded on
our journey, and, dining at Chester, got to
Philadelphia about nine o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, completely tired of our ride, having
been three days and three nights on
the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not have been thus particular,
but I wished to give you a specimen of the
American mode of travelling, though you
will understand that these difficulties are
to be met with only at that season of the
year when the frost breaks up, and the
roads get sadly out of order; for in summer
time nothing can be more agreeable,
expeditious, and pleasant. The fare from
Baltimore to Philadelphia is 6 dollars, or
27s., and the customary charges on the
road are &frac12; dollar for breakfast, 1 dollar
for dinner, wine not included, &frac12; dollar for
supper, and &frac14; dollar for beds. These are
their general prices, and they charge the
same whatever they provide for you. By
this, you will observe that travelling in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
these settled parts of the country is about
as expensive as in England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The country between Baltimore and
Philadelphia is of a <i>clayey</i> nature, mixed
with a kind of gravel; yet still, in the
hands of a skilful farmer, capable of yielding
good produce. The land on each side
of the road, and back into the country, was
pretty well cultivated, and (though winter)
bore marks of industry and economy.
Hedges are not frequent; but instead of
them they place split logs angular-wise on
each other, making what they call a &ldquo;worm
fence,&rdquo; and which is raised about five feet
high. This looks very slovenly, and,
together with the stumps of trees remaining
in all the new-cleared plantations, is a
great <i>desight</i> to the scenery of the country....
From Newark to New York is
about nine miles, and the greatest part of
the road is over a large swamp, which lies
between and on each side of the Pasaik
and Hackinsac rivers. Over this swamp
they have made a causeway, which trembles
the whole way as you go over it,<a name="FNanchor_22_24" id="FNanchor_22_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_24" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
shows how far the genius and industry of
man will triumph over natural impediments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To New York, which is ninety-six
miles from Philadelphia, we were a day
and a half in coming. The roads were not
so bad as when we came from Baltimore.
Our fare was 6 dollars, and the charges on
the road the same as between Baltimore and
Philadelphia:&mdash;viz., &frac12; dollar breakfast, 1
dollar dinner, &frac12; dollar supper, and &frac14; dollar
lodging.... The inhabitants of New York
are very fond of music, dancing, and plays;
an attainment to excellence in the former
has been considerably promoted by the
frequent musical societies and concerts
which are held in the city, many of the
inhabitants being very good performers.
As to dancing, there are two assembly-rooms
in the city, which are pretty well
frequented during the winter season;
private balls are likewise not uncommon.
They have two theatres, one of which is
lately erected, and is capable of containing
a great number of persons; there is an
excellent company of comedians, who perform
here in the winter. But the amuse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>ment
of which they seem most passionately
fond is that of sleighing, which is riding on
the snow in what <i>you</i> call <i>a sledge</i>, drawn
by two horses. It is astonishing to see
how anxiously persons of all ages and both
sexes look out for a good fall of snow, that
they may enjoy their favourite amusement;
and when the happy time comes, to see
how eager they are to engage every sleigh
that is to be hired. Parties of twenty or
thirty will sometimes go out of town in
these vehicles towards evening, about six
or eight miles, when, having sent for a
fiddler, and danced till they are tired, they
will return home again by moonlight, or,
perhaps more often, by <i>day</i> light. Whilst
the snow is on the ground no other carriages
are made use of, either for pleasure
or service. The productions of the earth
are brought to market in sleighs; merchandise
is draughted about in sleighs;
coaches are laid by, and the ladies and
gentlemen mount the <i>silent</i> car, and nothing
is heard in the streets but the tinkling<a name="FNanchor_23_25" id="FNanchor_23_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_25" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of bells.... I set off on the <i>1st</i> of <i>September,
1796</i>, to make a tour of the western
country,&mdash;that land of Paradise, according
to the flattering accounts given by Imlay
and others. Wishing to go to the new
city of Washington, <i>we</i><a name="FNanchor_24_26" id="FNanchor_24_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_26" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> took our route
through Philadelphia and Baltimore, which
I have already described. I shall not
trouble you with any further remarks,
excepting that as the season was just the
reverse of what it was when I passed
through this country last, it presented quite
a different appearance from what I described
to you in my former letters. Besides,
there was none of that inconvenience
from bad roads, so terrible to a traveller in
the winter. On the contrary, we went on
with a rapidity and safety equal to any
mode of travelling in England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Baltimore to the new city of
Washington is forty-five miles, where we
arrived on the <i>5th</i> of <i>October</i> following.
The road is well furnished with taverns,
which in general are good, at least as good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
as can be expected in this part of the
world. Close to Washington is a handsome
town called Georgetown; in fact, it will
form part of the new city; for, being so
near the site intended for it, and being laid
out nearly on the same plan, its streets will
be only a prolongation of the streets laid
out for the city of Washington: so it will
in course of time lose its name of Georgetown,
and adopt the general one of Washington.
Much in the same manner the
small places formerly separated from the
metropolis of England have lost their
name, and fallen under the general denomination
of London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Georgetown is situated on a hill close
to the river Potomak; it presents a beautiful
view from the surrounding country, of
which also it commands a fine prospect. It
is a seaport town, and some of their vessels
are employed in the London trade. There
are stages run daily between this place and
Baltimore, for which you pay four dollars.
There are also stages to and from Alexandria,
a handsome and flourishing town
situated on the Potomak, lower down the
stream, and about eight miles off; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
which you pay a fare of three quarters of a
dollar. We put up at the Federal Arms
whilst we were there. It is a good inn,
but their charges are most extravagantly
high.... At about half-past one, <i>October
7th</i>, we started on our journey over the
Allegany mountains to Pittsburgh.<a name="FNanchor_25_27" id="FNanchor_25_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_27" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> About
fourteen miles on the road is a pretty little
town called Montgomery Court House;<a name="FNanchor_26_28" id="FNanchor_26_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_28" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
contains some good houses, but the streets
are narrow. About seven miles further
is a little settlement, formed a few years
back by Captain Lingham, called Middlebrook.
Captain Lingham has a house on
the road, near a mill, which he has erected;
and here (following the example of many
of his brother officers) he has retired from
the toils and bustle of war, to spend his
days in the enjoyments of a country life.
We arrived here about six o&rsquo;clock; the sun
was just setting, yet there was time to go
another stage; but, as we got into a part of
the country where <i>taverns</i><a name="FNanchor_27_29" id="FNanchor_27_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_29" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> were not very
frequent, we proposed stopping here this
night. Accordingly, putting our horses
up at a little tavern, (which, together with
four or five more houses, composed the
whole of the settlement,) we had a comfortable
supper and went to bed. About half-past
six the next morning we started from
this place, and stopped, about seven miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
on the road, at an old woman&rsquo;s of the name
of Roberts.<a name="FNanchor_28_30" id="FNanchor_28_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_30" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> This old woman (whose
house, I believe, was the only one we saw
on the road) acts at times in the capacity
of a tavern-keeper: that is, a person travelling
that way, and straitened for provisions,
would most probably find something there
for himself and his horse. The old lady
was but just up when we called; her house
had more the appearance of a hut than the
habitation of an hostess, and when we
entered there was scarcely room to turn
round. We were loath to stop here; but
there not being any other house near, we
were obliged to do it, both for the sake of
ourselves and our horses. We soon made
her acquainted with our wants, and she,
gathering together a few sticks, (for her
fire was not yet lighted,) and getting a little
meal and some water, mixed us up some
cakes, which were soon dressed at the fire,
and then all sitting down at the table, and
having mixed some tea in a little pot, we
enjoyed a very comfortable breakfast. The
poor old woman, who was a widow, seemed
to live in a deal of distress: the whole of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
her living was acquired by furnishing accommodation
to travellers. When we were
sitting over the fire, and partaking of our
meal-cakes with this old woman, it brought
to mind the story of Elijah and the widow,
(I Kings, chap, xvii.,) particularly where
she answers him with, &lsquo;As the Lord thy
God liveth, I have not a cake, but one handful
of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a
cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two
sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me
and my son, that we may eat it, and die.&rsquo;
The appositeness of our situations rendered
this passage very striking, and made me
look upon my hostess in a more favourable
point of view than when I first saw her. I
gave her something to render her situation
more comfortable and happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leaving this lonely habitation, we continued
on our journey, and crossing the
Sinecocy [Monocacy?] river, about eleven
miles on the road, we reached Fredericktown,
about four miles farther, at twelve
o&rsquo;clock. This is a large flourishing place,
contains a number of good houses, and is a
place of great trade, owing to its being the
thoroughfare to the western country of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Pennsylvania and the Ohio. There is a large
manufactory of rifle-guns carried on here;
but so great is the demand for them, that
we could not meet with one in the whole
place: they sell in general from 15 to 25
dollars each, according to their style of
being mounted. The tavern where we
stopped was kept by Mrs. Kemble: it is a
tolerably good house. After dinner we
left this place, and after going about three
or four miles, we arrived at the foot of the
Appalachian Mountains. And here let me
stop a little to make a few observations on
the face of the country we have just passed
over. From Georgetown to this place, it
almost wholly consists of a sandy, gravelly
soil, with difficulty repaying the husbandman
for the trouble of tilling it. The face
of the country is very uneven, being a constant
succession of hill and dale. Little
towns or villages are scattered over the
country at the distance of seven or eight
miles, which communicate with each other
by roads which are almost inaccessible
during the winter and spring months. Our
charges on this part of the road were half
a dollar each for breakfast and dinner and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
supper, without any distinction of fare. If
our table were spread with all the profusion
of American luxury, such as ham, cold
beef, fried chicken, &amp;c. &amp;c., (which are not
uncommon for breakfast in this part of the
world), or whether we sat down to a dish
of tea and hoe-cake, our charge was all the
same. The accommodations we met with
on the road were pretty well, considering
the short time this country has been settled,
and the character and disposition of its
inhabitants, which are not those of the
most polished nations, but a character and
disposition arising from a consciousness of
independence, accompanied by a spirit and
manner highly characteristic of this consciousness.
It is not education alone that
forms this character of the Americans: it
stands upon a firmer basis than this. The
means of subsistence being so easy in the
country, and their dependence on each
other consequently so trifling, that spirit
of servility to those above them so prevalent
in European manners, is wholly
unknown to them; and they pass their
lives without any regard to the smiles or
the frowns of men in power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly the whole of the way from
Georgetown to Fredericktown we preserved
a distant view of the Allegany Mountains,
at whose feet we were now arrived. They
presented to us one general bluff appearance,
extending as far as our eye could see
from the north-east to the south-west. Our
approach to them was in a line perpendicular
to that of their extension, so that they
seemed to bid defiance to our progress.
The <i>Allegany Mountains</i> is a name given to
a range of several ridges of mountains
stretching from Vermont to Carolina, of
which one ridge alone is properly called the
Allegany Mountain. These ridges are
nearly 170 miles in width; and the middle
one, or the Allegany, forms the backbone
of the rest. The ridge which first presented
itself to our view, is called in
Howell&rsquo;s Map the South Mountain. The
road (which here began to be very rocky
and stony) is carried over the least elevated
part of the mountain, and from its summit
we beheld that beautiful limestone valley
so recommended by Brissot. On our descent
from this mountain, we entered on
one of the finest tracts of land in all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
America. The celebrated valley, which
lies between this and the next ridge of
mountains, extends from the Susquehanna
on the north to Winchester on the south,
is richly watered by several navigable
streams, and is capable of producing every
article which is raised in the neighbouring
countries in the greatest abundance. It is
inhabited chiefly by Germans and Dutch,
who are an industrious race of men and
excellent farmers. Their exertions have
made this valley (bounded on each side by
barren and inhospitable mountains) assume
the appearance of a highly cultivated country,
abounding in all the conveniences and
some of the luxuries of life. Besides a
general appearance of comfortable farms
scattered over the face of the country, it
can boast of several large and populous
towns, which keep up a connexion with
the cities on the Atlantic, and supply the
interior of this mountainous country with
the produce of distant nations. It was dark
before we descended from this mountain;
but we had not proceeded far in the valley
when we came to a little place called
Boone&rsquo;s-town, where we were glad to rest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
ourselves and horses after the fatigues of
so rough a road. Boone&rsquo;s-town is eight
miles from Fredericktown: it has not been
settled above three or four years. We met
with a very good tavern and excellent accommodations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Boone&rsquo;s-town, the next morning
(<i>Sunday, October 9th, 1796</i>) we passed
through Funk&rsquo;s-town, which is another new-settled
place; and immediately on leaving
this, Hagar&rsquo;s-town presented itself to our
view, about two miles off: here we arrived
to breakfast. Hagar&rsquo;s-town<a name="FNanchor_29_31" id="FNanchor_29_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_31" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> is a large
flourishing place, and contains some good
houses. The streets are narrow, and,
agreeably to a barbarous custom which they
have in laying out new towns in America,
the court-house is built in the <i>middle</i> of the
principal street, which is a great obstruction
to the passage, as well as being of an
uncouth appearance. This place is situated
on a fine plain, and, like Frederick&rsquo;s-town,
is a place of great trade, and also a manufactory
for rifle-guns, of which we bought
two at twenty dollars each. Here is a
paper published weekly; and assemblies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
are held here during the winter. There
is also a great deal of horse-racing in the
neighbourhood at stated seasons. We put
up at the Indian Queen, kept by Ragan: it
is a good house and much frequented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Hagar&rsquo;s-town we proceeded on to
Greencastle, which is a poor little place,
but lately settled, and consisting of a few
log-houses built along the road. We
stopped at one of these houses, which they
called the tavern, kept by one Lawrence;
it was a poor miserable place. We were
obliged to unsaddle our horses, put them
into the stable, and feed them ourselves;
and then, having got something to eat and
refreshed ourselves, we got out of this
place as soon as we could. Greencastle is
eleven miles from Hagar&rsquo;s-town; and we
had to go eleven miles farther that evening
to Mr. Lindsay&rsquo;s, whom we had engaged
at Baltimore to carry some goods to Pittsburgh
in his waggons. His house lay at
some distance from the road we were
going, so that we struck across the woods
to approach it; and, after having missed
our way once or twice, we struck on a road
which took us down to his house. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
we were hospitably entertained for two
days by Mr. Lindsay and his father-in-law,
Mr. Andrews, who have a very excellent
farm, and live very comfortably in the
truly American style. The place at which
he resides is called the <i>Falling Springs</i>; for
what reason they are called <i>falling</i> springs
I cannot conceive; they <i>rise</i> from under an
old tree, and the stream does not proceed
three hundred yards before it turns a cyder-mill;
and a little farther on turns a grist-mill.
These mills belong to Mr. Andrews,
as also does a large quantity of the land
around; for in this country <i>all</i> the farmers
are landholders; Mr. and Mrs. Andrews
are Irish; and they and their family are all
settled in the neighbourhood. Their children
are all brought up in industry, and
have their time fully employed in performing
the different necessary duties of the
house and farm. Nevertheless, they appear
to live very happy and comfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tuesday, October 11th, 1796.</i>&mdash;About
eleven o&rsquo;clock this morning we set off
from Mr. Andrews&rsquo;s, in company with a
party of several of the neighbouring farmers
who were going to Chambersburgh to vote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
at an election. Chambersburgh is about
three miles from Mr. Andrews&rsquo;s, and is a
large and flourishing place, not inferior to
Frederick&rsquo;s-town or Hagar&rsquo;s-town; being,
like them, on the high road to the western
country, it enjoys all the advantages which
arise from such a continual body of people
as are perpetually emigrating thither. I
have seen ten and twenty waggons at a
time in one of these towns, on their way to
Pittsburgh and other parts of the Ohio,
from thence to descend down that river to
Kentucky. These waggons are loaded
with the clothes and necessaries of a number
of poor emigrants, who follow on foot
with their wives and families, who are
sometimes indulged with a ride when they
are tired, or in bad weather. In this manner
they will travel and take up their abode
in the woods on the side of the road, like
the gypsies in our country, taking their provisions
with them, which they dress on the
road&rsquo;s side, as occasion requires.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About thirteen miles from Chambersburgh,
which we left in the afternoon, is a
place called the <i>Mill</i>,<a name="FNanchor_30_32" id="FNanchor_30_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_32" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> which is kept by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
some Dutchmen. We understood it was a
tavern, but were disappointed; however,
as it was now dark, and no tavern on the
road for some distance, we were under the
necessity of begging a lodging here, which
was granted us at last with the greatest
reluctance. Here we had rather an unfavourable
specimen of Dutch manners.
We were <i>kindly</i> directed to take our horses
to the stables, and take care of them ourselves,
which we accordingly did; and,
returning to the house, I was witness to a
kind of meal I had never before experienced.
First of all, some sour milk was
warmed up and placed on the table. This
at any other time would probably have
made us sick; but having fasted nearly the
whole day, and seeing no appearance of
anything else likely to succeed it, we
devoured it very soon; particularly as the
whole family (of which there were seven
or eight) partook of it likewise; all of us
sitting round <i>one</i> large bowl, and dipping
our spoons in one after another. When
this was finished a dish of stewed pork was
served up, accompanied with some hot
pickled cabbage, called in this part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
country &ldquo;warm slaw.&rdquo; This was devoured in
the same hoggish manner, every one trying
to help himself first, and two or three eating
off the same plate, and all in the midst of
filth and dirt. After this was removed a
large bowl of cold milk and bread was put
on the table, which we partook of in the
same manner as the first dish, and in the
same disorder. The spoons were immediately
taken out of the greasy pork dish, and
(having been just cleaned by passing
through the <i>mouth</i>) were put into the milk;
and that, with all the <i>sang froid</i> necessarily
attending such habitual nastiness. Our
<i>table</i>, which was none of the cleanest (for
as to <i>cloth</i>, they had none in the house),
was placed in the middle of the room,
which appeared to me to be the receptacle
of all the filth and rubbish in the house; and
a fine large fire, which blazed at one end,
served us instead of a candle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wishing to go to bed as soon as possible
(though, by the by, we did not expect
that our accommodations would be any of
the most agreeable), we requested to be
shown to our room, when, lo! we were
ushered up a ladder, into a dirty place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
where a little hole in the wall served for a
window, and where there were four or five
beds as dirty as need be. These beds did
not consist (as most beds do) of blankets,
sheets, &amp;c., but were truly in the Dutch
style, being literally nothing more than
one feather bed placed on another, between
which we were to creep and lie down.
The man, after showing us this our place
of destination, took the candle away, and
left us to get in how we could, which we
found some difficulty in doing at first;
however, after having accomplished it, we
slept very soundly till morning, when we
found we had passed the night amongst the
whole family, men, women, and children,
who had occupied the other beds, and who
had come up after we had been asleep.
We got up early in the morning from this
inhospitable and filthy place, and, saddling
our horses, pursued our journey.</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>October 12th, 1796.</i>&mdash;At ten o&rsquo;clock we
arrived at McConnell&rsquo;s-town, in Cove Valley
(thirteen miles), having first passed
over a high ridge called, in Howell&rsquo;s Map,
the North Mountain; and here we left that
beautiful valley, which is enriched by so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
many streams, and abounds with such a
profusion of the conveniences of life; a
country than which, if we except Kentucky,
is not to be found a more fertile one in the
whole of the United States.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On our descent from the North Mountain
we caught, through every opening of
the woods, the distant view of McConnell&rsquo;s,
whose white houses, contrasted with the <i>sea</i>
of woods by which it was surrounded, appeared
like an island in the ocean. Our
near approach to it, however, rendered it
not quite so pleasing an object; for it consisted
but of a few log-houses, built after
the American manner, without any other
ornament than that of being whitened on
the <i>outside</i>. There was a pretty good tavern
kept here by a Dutchwoman, where we
stopped to breakfast; and, leaving this
place, we crossed a hill called Scrubheath,
at the end of which was Whyle&rsquo;s tavern
(ten miles): we did not stop, but went to
the top of Sideling Hill (two miles), where
there is a tavern kept by Skinner, where
we dined. Sideling Hill is so called from
the road being carried over this ridge, <i>on
the side of the hill</i>, the whole way; it is very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
steep in ascent, and towards the top appears
very tremendous on looking down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From this tavern to the Junietta, a
branch of the Susquehannah river, is eight
miles. The hill terminates at the river,
and the road down to it is a narrow winding
path, apparently cleft out of the mountain.
It so happened that when we came
to this defile, a travelling man with a number
of packhorses had just entered it before
us; and as it was impossible for us to pass
them, we were obliged to follow them down
this long winding passage to the river, at
their own pace, which, poor animals, was
none of the speediest. The sun, though
not set, had been long hid from us by the
neighbouring mountains, and would not
lend us one ray to light us on our melancholy
path. We fell into conversation with
our fellow-traveller, and found that he had
been to Philadelphia, where he had purchased
a number of articles necessary to
those who live in this part of the country,
and which he was going to dispose of in
the best manner possible. The gloominess
of our path, and the temper of mind I happened
to be then in, threw me into reflec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>tions
on a comparison of this man&rsquo;s state
with my own. At length a distant light
broke me from my reverie, and indicated
to us a near prospect of our enlargement
from this obscure path; and the first thing
that presented itself to our view was the
Junietta river, which, flowing with a gentle
stream between two very steep hills,
covered with trees to the very top, the sun
just shining, and enlightening the opposite
side, though hid to us, presented one of
the most enchanting and romantic scenes I
ever experienced. From this place to Hartley&rsquo;s
Tavern is eight miles, and this we
had to go before night. It was sunset before
we had reached the summit of the opposite
hill of the river. From this hill we
beheld ourselves in the midst of a mountainous
and woody country; the Junietta
winding and flowing on each side of us at
the foot of the hill; the distant mountains
appearing in all the <i>wildness of majesty</i>,
and extending below the horizon. The
moon had just begun to spread her silver
light; and by her assistance we were
enabled to reach our destined <i>port</i>. The
road, which was carried along the side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
a tremendously high hill, seemed to
threaten us with instant death, if our horses
should make a false step. Embosomed in
woods, on a lonely path, we travelled by
the kind light of the moon till near eight
o&rsquo;clock, when we reached our place of destination.
It was a very comfortable house,
kept by one Hartley, an Englishman, and
situated in a gap of the mountains, called
in this part of the country Warrior&rsquo;s Gap,
and which affords an outlet or passage for
the Junietta river, which here is a fine gentle
stream. The country just about here was
very mountainous; yet our landlord had
got a very pleasant spot cleared and cultivated,
and which furnished him with the
principal necessaries of life. Finding this
an agreeable place, we stopped here three
days, and went up into the mountains to
shoot; but, being very young hands at this
diversion, we were always unsuccessful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On <i>Saturday, October 15th</i>, we set off
from Hartley&rsquo;s about eleven o&rsquo;clock, and
proceeded to Redford (six miles), which is
a pleasant place, and agreeably situated,
and contains a great many houses. The
town is supplied with water from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
neighbouring hills; conveyed in pipes to
each house, and to a public place in the
middle of the town. We left this place
about half-past twelve, and proceeded to
Ryan&rsquo;s tavern, at the foot of the Allegany
mountain (eleven miles). Here we dined;
and after dinner, we proceeded up the
mountain, the top of which we reached
about five o&rsquo;clock; and here I was surprised
to find a number of little streams of water
flowing through some as fine land as is to
be met with in the United States, and
abounding with fish. This appearance
upon the top of so high a mountain is not
a little remarkable; but I have since found
it to be the case in other ridges of mountains
which I have passed over. We intended
to have gone on to Webster&rsquo;s this evening,
but the weather proving so bad, we
called at a little house on the road, in
order to stop during the night. But we
were informed that they could not accommodate
us; however, they directed us to a
person about a mile off, where they thought
we could get accommodated; accordingly,
striking across the woods, we proceeded to
this house, and, after some little trouble,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and in a very tempestuous night, we found
it out, and here took up our abode for the
night. Our landlord&rsquo;s name was Statler,
and his residence is about eight miles
from Ryan&rsquo;s. Here we found a very comfortable
habitation, and very good accommodation;
and though situated at the top
of the highest ridge of mountains, we
experienced not only the comforts, but also
some of the luxuries of life. From the
stone which forms the base of this mountain
they make mill-stones, which are sent to
all parts of the country, and sell from
fifteen to twenty and thirty dollars a pair.
Land sells on these mountains for two dollars
an acre. We found this so comfortable
a place, that we stopped here to breakfast
the next morning (<i>October 16th</i>), and
then we proceeded to Webster&rsquo;s, at a place
called Stoystown (nine miles), where there
is a good tavern, and where we stopped to
bait our horses. About a mile before we
came to Webster&rsquo;s we passed over Stoney
Creek, which has a great many different
branches, and rather large, but most of
them were dry, owing partly to the season,
and partly to their lying so very high.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
About nine miles further we stopped at
Murphy&rsquo;s, where we baited our horses; but
the habitation was so uncomfortable, and
their accommodations so miserable, that
we could get nothing for ourselves; we
were therefore obliged to defer till the
evening taking any refreshment. On leaving
this place we crossed Laurel Hill, which
is near nine miles long, and which is the
highest ridge of the Apalachian mountains:
it is rather a ridge upon a ridge, than a
mountain by itself, as it rises upon the
Allegany ridge. The perpendicular height
of this ridge is 4,200 feet; and in crossing
it we were not a little incommoded by the
cold winds and rain which generally infest
the summit. This, together with the badness
of the roads (being nothing but large
loose stones), made it one of the most unpleasant
rides I ever experienced. It was
near dark before we descended this mountain;
and we had then to go three miles to
a poor miserable hut, where we were
obliged to spend the night amidst the whole
family and some other travellers, all scattered
about in the same room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About half-past six the next morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
(<i>October 17th, 1796</i>) we set out from King&rsquo;s,
and crossing Chestnut ridge, we arrived at
Letty Bean&rsquo;s to breakfast (seven and a half
miles). After crossing Chestnut ridge we
took our leave of the Apalachian mountains,
having passed 170 miles over them, from
the Blue ridge to Chestnut ridge. These
mountains are for the most part very stony
and rocky, yet have a great quantity of
fine land on them, even on their very summits.
The roads which are carried over
them are much better than I expected;
and if from the tops of them you can
(through an opening of the trees) gain a
view of the surrounding country, it appears
like a sea of woods; and all those hills
which appeared very high in our passing
over them, are lost in one wide plane, extending
as far as the eye can reach, at least
fifty or sixty miles, presenting a view not
only novel, but also highly majestic. At
other times, when you get between the declivities
of the mountains, they appear in
all the wildness of nature, forming the most
romantic scenery the imagination can picture.
It is not to be supposed, that immediately
on leaving the Apalachian moun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>tains
the country subsides into a smooth
level; on the contrary, for several miles,
both on the eastern and western side, the
country is very hilly, not to say sometimes
mountainous; and it is said that the western
side of the mountains is 300 feet above
the level of the eastern side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the foot of the mountains to Pittsburgh
is about forty miles, and here we
arrived to dinner on the <i>18th October</i>, having
gone, during our route, about 297 miles
from Philadelphia. The accommodations
we met with were, upon the whole, tolerably
good; at least, such as a person (considering
the country he was travelling in)
might bear with: charges rather high. It
cost us, together with our horses, two
dollars a day each. The common charges
on the eastern side of the mountains
were:&mdash;For breakfast, dinner, and supper,
&frac12; dollar each; oats, 12 cents. per gallon.
On the western side, dinner and supper
were charged sometimes 2s., sometimes
2s. 6d., and breakfasts, 18d., (Pennsylvania
currency). For breakfast we generally
used to have coffee, and buck-wheat
cakes, and some fried venison or broiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
chicken, meat being inseparable from an
American breakfast; and whatever travellers
happened to stop at the same place,
sat down at the same table, and partook of
the same dishes, whether they were poor,
or whether they were rich; no distinction
of persons being made in this part of the
country....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The waggons which come over the
Allegany mountains from the Atlantic
states, (bringing dry goods and foreign
manufactures for the use of the back-country
men,) return from this place generally
empty; though sometimes they are laden
with deer and bear skins and beaver furs,
which are brought in by the hunters, and
sometimes by the Indians, and exchanged
at the stores for such articles as they may
stand in need of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passing down the Ohio River Mr. Baily
proceeded with a pioneer party the leader
of which, Mr. Heighway, was about to
found a town on the banks of the Little
Miami River in Ohio. Leaving the river
at the newly located village of Columbia,
Ohio, the party pushed on northward. Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Baily accompanied them out of curiosity,
and his record is of utmost interest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Saturday, March 4th, 1797</i>,&mdash;the two
waggons started, accompanied with a guide
to conduct them through the wilderness,
and three or four pioneers to clear the road
of trees where there might be occasion;
and on</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Monday, March 6th</i>,&mdash;Dr. Bean and
myself started about noon, accompanied by
several others in the neighbourhood; some
of whom were tempted by curiosity, and
others with a prospect of settling there.
We were mounted on horses, and had each
a gun; and across our saddles we had slung
a large bag, containing some corn for our
horses, and provision for ourselves, as also
our blankets: the former was necessary, as
the grass had not yet made its appearance
in the woods. We kept the road as long
as we could; and when that would not
assist us any farther, we struck out into the
woods; and towards sundown found ourselves
about twenty miles from Columbia.
Here, having spied a little brook running
at the bottom of a hill, we made a halt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and kindling a fire, we fixed up our blankets
into the form of a tent, and having fed
both ourselves and our horses, we laid ourselves
down to rest; one of us, by turns,
keeping watch, lest the Indians should
come and steal our horses. The next
morning,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tuesday, March 7th</i>,&mdash;as soon as it was
light, we continued our journey, and towards
the middle of the day overtook our
friend H.,<a name="FNanchor_31_33" id="FNanchor_31_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_33" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> almost worn out with fatigue.
The ground was so moist and swampy, and
he had been obliged to come through such
almost impassable ways, that it was with
difficulty the horses could proceed; they
were almost knocked up; his waggons had
been over-turned twice or thrice;&mdash;in fact,
he related to us such a dismal story of the
trials both of patience and of mind which
he had undergone, and I verily believe if
the distance had been much greater, he
would either have sunk under it, or have
formed his settlement on the spot. We encouraged
him with the prospect of a speedy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
termination, and the hopes of better ground
to pass over; and with this his spirits seemed
to be somewhat raised. We all encamped
together this night, and made ourselves as
happy and as comfortable as possible. My
friend H. seemed also to put on the new
man; and from this, and from his being
naturally of a lively turn, we found that it
was a great deal the want of society which
had rendered him so desponding, and so
out of spirits; for after we had cooked
what little refreshment we had brought
with us, and finished our repast, he sang
us two or three good songs, (which he was
capable of doing in a masterly style,) and
seemed to take a pleasure in delaying as
long as he could that time which we ought
to have devoted to rest. As to my own
part, I regarded the whole enterprise in a
more philosophic point of view; and I may
say with the Spectator, I considered myself
as a silent observer of all that passed before
me; and could not but fancy that I saw in
this little society before me the counterpart
of the primitive ages, when men used
to wander about in the woods with all their
substance, in the manner that the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
race of Tartars do at this day. I could not
but think that I saw in miniature the peregrinations
of Abraham, or &AElig;neas, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning, <i>Wednesday, March
8th</i>, by day-light, our cavalcade was in
motion; and some of the party rode on
first to discover the spot, for we were
travelling without any other guide than
what little knowledge of the country the
men had acquired by hunting over it. I
could not but with pleasure behold with
what expedition the pioneers in front
cleared the way for the waggon; there
were but three or four of them, and they
got the road clear as fast as the waggon
could proceed. Whilst we were continuing
on at this rate, we observed at some distance
before us, a human being dart into the
woods, and endeavour to flee from us.
Ignorant what this might mean, we delayed
the waggons, and some of us went into the
woods and tracked the footsteps of a man
for some little distance, when suddenly a
negro made his appearance from behind
some bushes, and hastily inquired whether
there were any Indians in our party, or
whether we had met with any. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
hideousness of the man&rsquo;s countenance,
(which was painted with large red spots
upon a black ground,) and his sudden appearance,
startled us at first; but soon
guessing his situation, we put him beyond
all apprehension, and informed him he was
perfectly safe. He then began to inform
us that he had been a prisoner among the
Indians ever since the close of the last
American war; and that he had meditated
his escape ever since he had been in their
hands, but that never, till now, had he been
able to accomplish it....</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could not but look upon the man
with an eye of pity and compassion, and
after giving him something to pursue his
journey with, and desiring him to follow
our track to Columbia, we separated. At
about three or four o&rsquo;clock the same afternoon,
we had the satisfaction of seeing the
Little Miami river. Here we halted, (for
it was on the banks of this river that the
town was laid out,) and we were soon
joined by our other companions, who had
proceeded on first, and who informed us
that they had recognized the spot about
half a mile higher up the river. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
accordingly went on, and got the goods all
out of the waggons that night, so that they
might return again as soon as they thought
proper. And here we could not but congratulate
our friend H. upon his arrival at
the seat of his new colony.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ZANE&rsquo;S TRACE AND THE MAYSVILLE PIKE</h3>


<p>In the study of the Ohio River as a highway
of immigration and commerce it
was emphasized that in earliest pioneer
days the ascent of the river was a serious
and difficult problem. This was true,
indeed, not on the Ohio alone, but on
almost every river of importance in the
United States. Of course brawny arms
could force a canoe through flood-tides and
rapids; but, as a general proposition, the
floods of winter, with ice floating fast
amid-stream and clinging in ragged blocks
and floes along the shore, and the droughts
of summer which left, even in the Ohio,
great bars exposed so far to the light that
the river could be forded here and there
by children, made even canoe navigation
well-nigh impossible. For other craft
than light canoes navigation was utterly
out of the question in the dry seasons and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
exceedingly dangerous on the icy winter
floods at night&mdash;when the shore could not
be approached.</p>

<p>Such conditions as these gave origin to
many of our land highways. Where
pioneer homes were built beside a navigable
river it was highly important to have a
land thoroughfare leading back to the
&ldquo;old settlements&rdquo; which could be traversed
at all seasons. Many of our &ldquo;river
roads&rdquo; came into existence, not because the
valleys offered the easiest courses for land
travel, but because pioneer settlements
were made on river banks, and, as the rivers
were often worthy of the common French
name &ldquo;Embarras,&rdquo; land courses were
necessary. In the greater rivers this
&ldquo;homeward track,&rdquo; so to speak, frequently
abandoned the winding valley and struck
straight across the interior on the shortest
available route.</p>

<p>The founding of Kentucky in the lower
Ohio Valley offers a specific instance to
illustrate these generalizations, and brings
us to the subject of a thoroughfare which
was of commanding importance in the old
West. We have elsewhere dealt at length<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
with the first settlement of Kentucky,
making clear the fact that the great road
blazed by Boone through Cumberland Gap
was the most important route in Kentucky&rsquo;s
early history. The growth of the importance
of the Ohio River as a thoroughfare
and its final tremendous importance to
Kentucky and the entire West has also
been reviewed. But, despite this importance,
the droughts of summer and the ice-torrents
of winter made a landward route
from Kentucky to Pennsylvania and the
East an absolute necessity. Even when the
river was navigable, the larger part of the
craft which sailed it before 1820 were not
capable of going up-stream. Heavy freight
could be &ldquo;poled&rdquo; and &ldquo;cordelled&rdquo; up in
the keel-boat and barge, but for all other
return traffic, both freight and passenger,
the land routes from Kentucky north and
east were preferable. For many years the
most available messenger and mail route
from Cincinnati, Vincennes, and Louisville
was over Boone&rsquo;s Wilderness Road through
Cumberland Gap. But, as the eighteenth
century neared its close, the large population
of western Pennsylvania and north<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>western
Virginia made necessary better
routes from the upper Ohio Valley across
the Alleghenies; in turn, the new conditions
demanded a route up the Ohio
Valley from Kentucky to Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In our survey of Indian Thoroughfares,
a slight path known as the Mingo Trail is
mentioned as leading across eastern Ohio
from Mingo Bottom near the present
Steubenville, on the Ohio River, to the
neighborhood of Zanesville on the Muskingum
River.<a name="FNanchor_32_34" id="FNanchor_32_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_34" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Mingo Bottom was a
well-known Indian camping-place; the
name is preserved in the railway junction
thereabouts, Mingo Junction. A distinct
watershed offers thoroughfare southwesterly
across to the Muskingum, and on
this lay the old trail. The termini of this
earliest known route were near two early
settlements of whites; Mingo Bottom lies
eight or nine miles north of Wheeling, one
of the important stations in the days of
border warfare. The Mingo Trail, swinging
southward a little, became the route of
white hunters and travelers who wished to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
cross what is now eastern Ohio. The Muskingum
River terminus of the trail was
Wills Town, as far down the Muskingum
from Zanesville as Mingo Bottom was
above Wheeling on the Ohio. It is altogether
probable that a slight trace left the
Wills Town trail and crossed the Muskingum
at the mouth of Licking River&mdash;the
present site of Zanesville. If a trail led
thence westwardly toward the famed Pickaway
Plains, it is recorded on none of our
maps. We know, therefore, of only the
Mingo Trail, running, let us say loosely,
from Wheeling, West Virginia, to Zanesville,
Ohio, which could have played any
part in forming what soon became known
as the first post road in all the Territory
Northwest of the River Ohio.</p>

<p>With the close of the Indian War and the
signing of the Treaty of Greenville in 1795,
the American possession of the Northwest
was placed beyond question. A flood of
emigrants at once left the eastern states
for the Central West, and the return
traffic, especially in the form of travelers
and private mail packets, from Kentucky
and Cincinnati, began at once to assume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
significant proportions, and Congress was
compelled to facilitate travel by opening a
post route two hundred and twenty-six
miles in length from the upper to the lower
Ohio. Accordingly, the following act:
&ldquo;<i>An Act to authorize Ebenezer Zane<a name="FNanchor_33_35" id="FNanchor_33_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_35" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> to locate
certain lands in the territory of the United
States northwest of the river Ohio</i>&rdquo; was
passed by Congress and approved May
17, 1796:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Be it enacted, &amp;c.</i>, That, upon the conditions
hereinafter mentioned, there shall
be granted to Ebenezer Zane three tracts of
land, not exceeding one mile square each,
one on the Muskingum river, one on Hockhocking
river, and one other on the north
bank of Scioto river, and in such situations
as shall best promote the utility of a road
to be opened by him on the most eligible
route between Wheeling and Limestone,<a name="FNanchor_34_36" id="FNanchor_34_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_36" class="fnanchor">[34]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
to be approved by the President of the
United States, or such person as he shall
appoint for that purpose; <i>Provided</i>, Such
tracts shall not interfere with any existing
claim, location, or survey; nor include any

<p>Zane evidently went at once to work
opening the road to Kentucky, his brother
Jonathan, and son-in-law John McIntire,
assisting largely in the work. The path
was only made fit for horsemen, particularly
mail-carriers. It is probable that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
task was not more difficult than to cut
away small trees on an Indian trace. It is
sure that for a greater part of the distance
from the Ohio to the Muskingum the Mingo
Trail was followed, passing near the center
of Belmont, Guernsey and Muskingum
Counties. The route to the southwest
from that point through Perry, Fairfield,
Pickaway, Ross, Richland, Adams, and
Brown Counties may or may not have followed
the path of an Indian trace. No
proof to the contrary being in existence, it
is most reasonable to suppose that this,
like most other pioneer routes, did follow a
more or less plainly outlined Indian path.
The new road crossed the Muskingum at
the present site of the town well named
Zanesville, the Hocking at Lancaster, the
Scioto at Chillicothe, and the Ohio at Aberdeen,
Ohio, opposite the old-time Limestone,
Kentucky.</p>

<p>One George Sample was an early traveler
on this National Road; paying a visit from
the East to the Ohio country in 1797, he
returned homeward by way of Zane&rsquo;s
Trace or the Maysville Road, as the route
was variously known. After purchasing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
farm on Brush Creek, Adams County, Ohio,
and locating a homeless emigrant on it,
Mr. Sample &ldquo;started back to Pennsylvania
on horseback&rdquo; according to his recorded
recollections written in 1842;<a name="FNanchor_36_38" id="FNanchor_36_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_38" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> &ldquo;as there
was no getting up the river at that day.<a name="FNanchor_37_39" id="FNanchor_37_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_39" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
In our homeward trip we had very rough
fare when we had any at all; but having
calculated on hardships, we were not disappointed.
There was one house (Treiber&rsquo;s)
on Lick branch, five miles from where
West Union<a name="FNanchor_38_40" id="FNanchor_38_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_40" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> now is.&rdquo; Trebar&mdash;according
to modern spelling&mdash;opened a tavern on
his clearing in 1798 or 1799, but at the
time of Sample&rsquo;s trip his house was not
more public than the usual pioneer&rsquo;s home
where the latch-string was always out.<a name="FNanchor_39_41" id="FNanchor_39_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_41" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
&ldquo;The next house,&rdquo; continues Mr. Sample,
&ldquo;was where Sinking spring or Middle-town
is now.<a name="FNanchor_40_42" id="FNanchor_40_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_42" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The next was at Chillicothe,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
which was just then commenced.
We encamped one night at Massie&rsquo;s run,
say two or three miles from the falls of
Paint creek, where the trace then crossed
that stream. From Chillicothe to Lancaster
the trace then went through the Pickaway
plains. There was a cabin some three
or four miles below the plains, and another
at their eastern edge, and one or two more
between that and Lancaster. Here we
staid the third night. From Lancaster we
went next day to Zanesville, passing
several small beginnings. I recollect no
improvement between Zanesville and
Wheeling, except a small one at the mouth
of Indian Wheeling creek, opposite to
Wheeling. In this space we camped
another night. From Wheeling we went
home pretty well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The matter of ferriage was a most important
item on pioneer roads as indicated
by the Act of Congress quoted. The
Court of General Quarter Sessions met at
Adamsville, Adams County, December 12,
1797, and made the following the legal
rates of ferriage across the Scioto and Ohio
Rivers, both of which Zane&rsquo;s Trace crossed:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner was Zane&rsquo;s Trace opened than
the Government established a mail route
between Wheeling and Maysville and Lexington.
For the real terminus of the trace
was not by any means at little Maysville;
an ancient buffalo route and well-worn
white man&rsquo;s road led into the interior of
Kentucky from Maysville, known in history
as the Maysville Road and Maysville Pike.
On the Ohio side this mail route from
Wheeling and Lexington was known by
many titles in many years; it was the
Limestone Road, the Maysville Pike, the
Limestone and Chillicothe Road, and the
Zanesville Pike; the Maysville and Zanes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>ville
Turnpike was constructed between
Zanesville and the Ohio River. At Zanesville
the road today is familiarly known as
the Maysville Pike while in Kentucky it is
commonly called the Zanesville Pike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the Indian trail gets widened,
graded and bridged to a good road,&rdquo; wrote
Emerson, &ldquo;there is a benefactor, there
is a missionary, a pacificator, a wealth-bringer,
a maker of markets, a vent for
industry.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_42_44" id="FNanchor_42_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_44" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The little road here under
consideration is unique among American
highways in its origin and in its history.
It was demanded, not by war, but by
civilization, not for exploration and settlement
but by settlements that were already
made and in need of communion and commerce.
It was created by an act of Congress
as truly as the Cumberland Road,
which soon should, in part, supersede it.
And finally it was on the subject of the
Maysville Turnpike that the question of
internal improvement by the national government
was at last decided when, in 1830,
President Jackson signed that veto which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
made the name of Maysville a household
word throughout the United States.</p>

<p>In 1825, after a delay which created great
suspense in the West, the Cumberland
Road at last leaped the Ohio River at
Wheeling. Zane&rsquo;s Trace, now a wide,
much-traveled avenue, offered a route westward
to Zanesville which could be but little
improved upon. The blazed tree gave
way to the mile-stone and the pannier and
saddle-bag to the rumbling stagecoach and
the chaise. It is all a pretty, quiet picture
and its story is totally unlike that of
Boone&rsquo;s rough path over the Cumberlands.
For settlements sprang up rapidly in this
land of plenty; we have seen that there
were beginnings at Chillicothe and Zanesville
when Sample passed this way in 1797.
By 1800, Zane&rsquo;s lots at the crossing of the
Hockhocking (first known as New Lancaster,
and later as Lancaster&mdash;from the town
of that name in Pennsylvania) were selling;
his terms and inducements to settlers,
especially mechanics, are particularly interesting.<a name="FNanchor_43_45" id="FNanchor_43_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_45" class="fnanchor">[43]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>As intimated, the Kentucky division of
the Maysville Pike&mdash;leading from the Ohio
River through Washington, Paris, and
Lexington&mdash;became famous in that it was
made a test case to determine whether or
not the Government had the right to assist
in the building of purely state (local) roads
by taking shares in local turnpike companies.</p>

<p>This much-mooted question was settled
once for all by President Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s
veto of &ldquo;A Bill Authorizing a subscription
of stock in the Maysville, Washington,
Paris, and Lexington Turnpike Road Company,&rdquo;
which was passed by the House
February 24, 1830. It read:<a name="FNanchor_44_46" id="FNanchor_44_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_46" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> &ldquo;<i>Be it
enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America in Congress
assembled</i>, That the Secretary of the
Treasury be, and he is hereby, authorized
and directed to subscribe, in the name and
for the use of the United States, for fifteen
hundred shares of the capital stock of the
Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington
Turnpike Road Company, and to pay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
for the same at such times, and in such
proportions, as shall be required of, and
paid by, the stockholders generally, by the
rules and regulations of the aforesaid company,
to be paid out of any money in the
Treasury, not otherwise appropriated: <i>Provided</i>,
That not more than one-third part
of the sum, so subscribed for the use of
the United States, shall be demanded in
the present year, nor shall any greater
sum be paid on the shares so subscribed
for, than shall be proportioned to assessments
made on individual or corporate
stockholders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That
the said Secretary of the Treasury shall
vote for the President and Directors of the
aforesaid company, according to such number
of shares as the United States may, at
any time, hold in the stock thereof, and
shall receive upon the said stock the proportion
of the tolls which shall, from time
to time, be due to the United States for
the shares aforesaid, and shall have and
enjoy, in behalf of the United States,
every other right of stockholder in said
Company.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his first annual message to Congress,
dated December 8, 1829, President Jackson
stated plainly his attitude to the great question
of internal improvements. &ldquo;As ...
the period approaches when the application
of the revenue to the payment of [national]
debt will cease, the disposition of the surplus
will present a subject for the serious
deliberation of Congress.... Considered
in connection with the difficulties which
have heretofore attended appropriations for
purposes of internal improvement, and with
those which this experience tells us will
certainly arise whenever power over such
subjects may be exercised by the General
Government, it is hoped that it may lead to
the adoption of some plan which will reconcile
the diversified interests of the States
and strengthen the bonds which unite
them.... To avoid these evils it appears
to me that the most safe, just, and federal
disposition which could be made of the surplus
revenue would be its apportionment
among the several States according to their
ratio of representation, and should this
measure not be found warranted by the
Constitution that it would be expedient to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
propose to the States an amendment
authorizing it.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_45_47" id="FNanchor_45_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_47" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In his veto of the Maysville Road bill
President Jackson quoted the above paragraphs
from his annual message, and, after
citing both Madison&rsquo;s and Monroe&rsquo;s positions
as to internal improvements of pure
local character, continues:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bill before me does not call for a
more definate opinion upon the particular
circumstances which will warrent appropriations
of money by Congress to aid
works of internal improvement, for although
the extention of the power to apply money
beyond that of carrying into effect the
object for which it is appropriated has, as
we have seen, been long claimed and
exercised by the Federal Government, yet
such grants have always been professedly
under the control of the general principle
that the works which might be thus aided
should be &lsquo;of a general, not local, national,
not State,&rsquo; character. A disregard of this
distinction would of necessity lead to the
subversion of the federal system. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
even this is an unsafe one, arbitrary in its
nature, and liable, consequently, to great
abuses, is too obvious to require the confirmation
of experience. It is, however,
sufficiently definate and imperative to my
mind to forbid my approbation of any bill
having the character of the one under consideration.
I have given to its
provisions ... reflection ... but I am not
able to view it in any other light than as a
measure of purely local character; or, if it
can be considered national, that no further
distinction between the appropriate duties
of the General and State Governments
need be attempted, for there can be no
local interest that may not with equal
propriety be denominated national. It has
no connection with any established system
of improvements; is exclusively within the
limits of a State, starting at a point on the
Ohio River and running out 60 miles to an
interior town, and even as far as the State
is interested conferring partial instead of
general advantages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Considering the magnitude and importance
of the power, and the embarrassments
to which, from the very nature of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
thing, its exercise must necessarily be subjected,
the real friends of internal improvement
ought not to be willing to confide it
to accident and chance. What is properly
<i>national</i> in its character or otherwise is an
inquiry which is often extremely difficult
of solution....</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it be the wish of the people
that the construction of roads and canals
should be conducted by the Federal
Government, it is not only highly
expedient, but indispensably necessary,
that a previous amendment of the Constitution,
delegating the necessary power and
defining and restricting its exercise with
reference to the sovereignty of the States,
should be made. The right to exercise as
much jurisdiction as is necessary to preserve
the works and to raise funds by the
collection of tolls to keep them in repair
can not be dispensed with. The Cumberland
Road should be an instructive admonition
of the consequences of acting without
this right. Year after year contests are
witnessed, growing out of efforts to obtain
the necessary appropriations for completing
and repairing this useful work. Whilst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
one Congress may claim and exercise the
power, a succeeding one may deny it; and
this fluctuation of opinion must be unavoidably
fatal to any scheme which from its
extent would promote the interests and elevate
the character of the country....</p>

<p>&ldquo;That a constitutional adjustment of this
power upon equitable principles is in the
highest degree desirable can scarcely be
doubted, nor can it fail to be promoted by
every sincere friend to the success of our
political institutions.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_46_48" id="FNanchor_46_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_48" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The effect of Jackson&rsquo;s veto was far-reaching.
It not only put an end to all
thought of national aid to such local improvements
as the Maysville Turnpike, but
deprived such genuinely national promotions
as the Baltimore and Ohio Railway of
all hope of national aid. &ldquo;President Jackson
had strongly expressed his opposition to
aiding state enterprises and schemes of
internal improvement by appropriations
from the central government,&rdquo; records a
historian of that great enterprise; &ldquo;from
whatever source the opposition may have
come, the [Baltimore and Ohio Railway]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
company recognized that it must not hope
for aid from the national government.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_47_49" id="FNanchor_47_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_49" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
The significance of Jackson&rsquo;s veto could
not be more strongly presented.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>PIONEER TRAVEL IN KENTUCKY</h3>


<p>The following interesting and vivid
picture of early travel in Kentucky
is taken from Judge James Hall&rsquo;s
<i>Legends of the West</i> (Philadelphia, 1832);
though largely a work of fiction, such
descriptions as these are as lifelike as the
original picture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The place at which the party landed
was a small village on the bank of the
[Ohio] river, distant about fifty miles from
a settlement in the interior to which they
were destined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are on dry land once more,&rdquo;
said the Englishman as he jumped ashore;
&ldquo;come, Mr. Logan, let us go to the stage-house
and take our seats.&rdquo; Logan smiled,
and followed his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said Edgarton, to a
tall, sallow man in a hunting-shirt, who sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
on a log by the river with a rifle in his lap,
&ldquo;can you direct us to the stage-house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say that I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you do not understand what
we want,&rdquo; said Edgarton; &ldquo;we wish to
take seats in a mail-coach for &mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, stranger, it&rsquo;s my sentimental
belief that there isn&rsquo;t a coach, male or
female, in the county.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This fellow is ignorant of our meaning,&rdquo;
said Edgarton to Logan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say, stranger? I <i>spose
maybe</i> you think I never <i>seed</i> a coach?
Well, it&rsquo;s a free country, and every man has
a right to think what he pleases; but I
reckon I&rsquo;ve saw as many of <i>them are fixens</i>
as any other man. I was raised in Tennessee.
I saw General Jackson once riding
in the elegantest carriage that ever mortal
man <i>sot</i> his eyes on&mdash;with glass winders
to it like a house, and <i>sort o&rsquo;</i> silk <i>curtings</i>.
The harness was mounted with silver; it
was <i>drawd</i> by four blooded nags, and <i>druv</i>
by a mighty likely <i>nigger</i> boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The travellers passed on, and soon
learned that there was indeed no stage in
the country. Teams and carriages of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
kind were difficult to be procured; and it
was with some difficulty that two stout
wagons were at last hired to carry Mr.
Edgarton&rsquo;s movables, and a <i>dearborn</i> obtained
to convey his family, it being agreed
that one of the gentlemen should drive
the latter vehicle while the other walked,
alternately. Arrangements were accordingly
made to set out the next morning.</p>

<p>The settlement in which Mr. Edgarton
had judiciously determined to pitch his
tent, and enjoy the healthful innocence and
rural felicity of the farmer&rsquo;s life, was new;
and the country to be traversed to reach it
entirely unsettled. There were two or
three houses scattered through the wilderness
on the road, one of which the party
might have reached by setting out early in
the morning, and they had determined to
do so. But there was so much fixing and
preparing to be done, so much stowing of
baggage and packing of trunks, such
momentous preparations to guard against
cold and heat, hunger and thirst, fatigue,
accident, robbery, disease, and death, that
it was near noon before the cavalcade was
prepared to move. Even then they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
delayed some minutes longer to give Mr.
Edgarton time to oil the screws and renew
the charges of his double-barrel gun and
pocket-pistols. In vain he was told there
were no highwaymen in America. His
way lay chiefly through uninhabited forests;
and he considered it a fact in natural history,
as indisputable as any other elementary
principle, that every such forest has
its robbers. After all, he entirely neglected
to put flints in his bran new locks
instead of the wooden substitutes which
the maker had placed there to protect his
work from injury; and thus &ldquo;doubly
armed,&rdquo; he announced his readiness to
start with an air of truly comic heroism.</p>

<p>When they began their journey, new
terrors arose. The road was sufficiently
plain and firm for all rational purposes;
that is to say, it <i>would do</i> very well for those
who only wanted to get along, and were
content to make the best of it. It was a
mere path beaten by a succession of travellers.
No avenue had been cut for it through
the woods; but the first pioneers had
wound their way among the trees, avoiding
obstacles by going round them, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
snake winds through the grass, and those
who followed had trodden in their footsteps,
until they had beaten a smooth road
sufficiently wide to admit the passage of a
single wagon. On either side was the thick
forest, sometimes grown up with underbrush
to the margin of the <i>trace</i>, and sometimes
so open as to allow the eye to roam
off to a considerable distance. Above was
a dense canopy of interwoven branches.
The wild and lonesome appearance, the
deep shade, the interminable gloom of the
woods, were frightful to our travellers.
The difference between a wild forest in
the simple majesty of nature, and the woodlands
of cultivated countries, is very great.
In the latter the underbrush has been removed
by art or destroyed by domestic
animals; the trees as they arrive at their
growth are felled for use, and the remainder,
less crowded, assume the spreading
and rounded form of cultivated trees.
The sunbeams reach the soil through the
scattered foliage, the ground is trodden
by grazing animals, and a hard sod is
formed. However secluded such a spot
may be, it bears the marks of civilization;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the lowing of cattle is heard, and many
species of songsters that hover round the
habitations of men, and are never seen in
the wilderness, here warble their notes. In
the western forests of America all is grand
and savage. The truth flashes instantly upon
the mind of the observer, with the force
of conviction, that Nature has been carrying
on her operations here for ages undisturbed.
The leaf has fallen from year to
year; succeeding generations of trees have
mouldered, spreading over the surface
layer upon layer of decayed fibre, until the
soil has acquired an astonishing depth and
an unrivalled fertility. From this rich bed
the trees are seen rearing their shafts to an
astonishing height. The tendency of
plants towards the light is well understood;
of course, when trees are crowded closely
together, instead of spreading, they shoot
upwards, each endeavouring, as it were, to
overtop his neighbours, and expending the
whole force of the vegetative powers in
rearing a great trunk to the greatest possible
height, and then throwing out a top
like an umbrella to the rays of the sun.
The functions of vitality are carried on with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
vigor at the extremities, while the long
stem is bare of leaves or branches; and
when the undergrowth is removed nothing
can exceed the gloomy grandeur of the
elevated arches of foliage, supported by
pillars of majestic size and venerable appearance.
The great thickness and age of
many of the trees is another striking
peculiarity. They grow from age to age,
attaining a gigantic size, and then fall, with
a tremendous force, breaking down all that
stands in their downward way, and heaping
a great pile of timber on the ground, where
it remains untouched until it is converted
into soil. Mingled with all our timber are
seen aspiring vines, which seem to have
commenced their growth with that of the
young trees, and risen with them, their
tops still flourishing together far above the
earth, while their stems are alike bare.
The undergrowth consists of dense thickets,
made up of the offspring of the larger trees,
mixed with thorns, briers, dwarfish vines,
and a great variety of shrubs. The ground
is never covered with a firm sward, and
seldom bears the grasses, or smaller plants,
being covered from year to year with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
dense mass of dried and decaying leaves,
and shrouded in eternal shade.</p>

<p>Such was the scene that met the eyes of
our travellers, and had they been treated to
a short excursion to the moon they would
scarcely have witnessed any thing more
novel. The wide-spread and trackless ocean
had scarcely conveyed to their imaginations
so vivid an impression of the vast and
solitary grandeur of Nature, in her pathless
wildernesses. They could hardly
realize the expectation of travelling safely
through such savage shades. The path,
which could be seen only a few yards in
advance, seemed continually to have terminated,
leaving them no choice but to retrace
their steps. Sometimes they came to a
place where a tree had fallen across the
road, and Edgarton would stop under the
supposition that any further attempt to
proceed was hopeless&mdash;until he saw the
American drivers forsaking the track,
guiding their teams among the trees,
crushing down the young saplings that
stood in their way, and thus winding round
the obstacle, and back to the road, often
through thickets so dense, that to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
stranger&rsquo;s eye it seemed as if neither man
nor beast could penetrate them. Sometimes
on reaching the brink of a ravine or
small stream, the bridge of logs, which
previous travellers had erected, was found
to be broken down, or the ford rendered
impassable; and the wagoners with the
same imperturbable good nature, and as if
such accidents were matters of course,
again left the road, and seeking out a new
crossing-place, passed over with scarcely
the appearance of difficulty.</p>

<p>Once they came to a sheet of water,
extending as far as the eye could reach, the
tall trees standing in it as thickly as upon
the dry ground, with tufts of grass and
weeds instead of the usual undergrowth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there a ferry here?&rdquo; inquired
Edgarton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, sir, it&rsquo;s nothing but <i>a slash</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, jist a sort o&rsquo; swamp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll jist put right ahead, sir; there&rsquo;s
no dif-<i>fick</i>-ulty; it&rsquo;s nice good driving all
about here. It&rsquo;s sort o&rsquo; muddy, but there&rsquo;s
good bottom to it all the way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>On they went. To Edgarton it was like
going to sea; for no road could be seen;
nothing but the trackless surface of the
water; but instead of looking down, where
his eye could have penetrated to the bottom,
he was glancing forward in the vain
hope of seeing dry land. Generally the
water was but a few inches deep, but sometimes
they soused into a hole; then Edgarton
groaned and the ladies screamed; and
sometimes it got gradually deeper until the
hubs of the wheels were immersed, and
the Englishman then called to the wagoners
to stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afeard, sir,&rdquo; one of them
replied, &ldquo;it is not bad; why this ain&rsquo;t
nothing; it&rsquo;s right good going; it ain&rsquo;t
a-going to swim your horse, no how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything seems a good road to you
where the horse will not have to swim,&rdquo;
replied the Englishman surlily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, bless you,&rdquo; said the backwoodsman,
&ldquo;this ain&rsquo;t no part of a priming to
places that I&rsquo;ve seed afore, no how. I&rsquo;ve
seed race paths in a worse fix than this.
Don&rsquo;t you reckon, stranger, that if my team
can drag this here heavy wagon, loaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
down with plunder, you can sartainly get
along with that <i>ar</i> little carry-all, and
nothing on the face of the <i>yeath</i> to tote,
but jist the women and children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had but one such swamp to pass.
It was only about half a mile wide, and
after travelling that far through the water,
the firm soil of the woods, which before
seemed gloomy, became cheerful by contrast;
and Edgarton found at last, that
however unpleasant such travelling may
be to those who are not accustomed to it,
it has really no dangers but such as are
imaginary.</p>

<p>As the cavalcade proceeded slowly, the
ladies found it most pleasant to walk wherever
the ground was sufficiently dry. Mrs.
Edgarton and the children might be seen
sauntering along, and keeping close to the
carriage, for fear of being lost or captured
by some nondescript monster of the wild,
yet often halting to gather nosegays of
wild flowers, or to examine some of the
many natural curiosities which surrounded
them....</p>

<p>The sun was about to set when the
wagoners halted at an open spot, covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
with a thick carpet of short grass, on the
margin of a small stream of clear water.
On inquiring the reason, Mr. Edgarton
was assured that this was the best <i>campground</i>
on the route, and as there was no
house within many miles, it was advisable
to make arrangements for passing the night
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed the European
gentleman; &ldquo;what! lie on the ground like
beasts! we shall all catch our death of cold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should never live through the night,&rdquo;
groaned his fair partner....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us stay here in the dark,
papa,&rdquo; cried the children.</p>

<p>Logan expressed the opinion that an
encampment might be made quite comfortable,
and the sentimental Julia declared
that it would be &ldquo;delightful!&rdquo; Edgarton
imprecated maledictions on the beggarly
country which could not afford inns for
travellers, and wondered if they expected a
gentleman to nestle among the leaves like
Robin Hood&rsquo;s foresters....</p>

<p>This storm, like other sudden gusts, soon
blew over, and the party began in earnest
to make the best of a bad business by ren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>dering
their situation as comfortable as
possible. The wagoners, though highly
amused at the fears of their companions,
showed great alacrity and kindness in their
endeavours to dissipate the apprehensions
and provide for the comfort of foreigners;
and, assisted by Mr. Logan, soon prepared
a shelter. This was made by planting
some large stakes in the ground, in the
form of a square, filling up the sides and
covering the tops with smaller poles, and
suspending blankets over and around it, so
as to form a complete enclosure. Mrs.
Edgarton had a carpet taken from the
wagons and spread on the ground; on this
the beds were unpacked and laid, trunks
were arranged for seats, and the emigrants
surprised at finding themselves in a comfortable
apartment, became as merry as
they had been before despondent. A fire
was kindled and the teakettle boiled, and
there being a large store of bread and provisions
already prepared, an excellent
repast was soon placed before them, and
eaten with the relish produced by severe
exercise.</p>

<p>The night had now closed in, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
blaze of a large fire and the light of
several candles threw a brilliant gleam
over the spot and heightened the cheerfulness
of the evening meal. The arrangements
for sleeping were very simple. The
tent, which had been divided into two
apartments by a curtain suspended in the
middle, accommodated all of Mr. Edgarton&rsquo;s
household: Logan drew on his greatcoat,
and spreading a single blanket on the
ground, threw himself down with his feet
to the fire; the teamsters crept into their
wagons, and the several parties soon enjoyed
that luxury which, if Shakspeare
may be believed, is often denied to the
&ldquo;head that wears a crown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The light of the morning brought with
it cheerfulness and merriment. Refreshed
from the fatigues of the preceding day,
inspired with new confidence, and amused
by the novelties that surrounded them, the
emigrants were in high spirits. Breakfast
was hastily prepared, and the happy party,
seated in a circle on the grass, enjoyed
their meal with a keen relish. The horses
were then harnessed and the cavalcade
renewed its march.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>The day was far advanced when they
began to rise to more elevated ground than
that over which they had travelled. The
appearance of the woods was sensibly
changed. They were now travelling over
a high upland tract with a gently-waving
surface, and instead of the rank vegetation,
the dense foliage and gloomy shades by
which they had been surrounded, beheld
woodlands composed of smaller trees
thinly scattered and intermingled with rich
thickets of young timber. The growth
though thick was low, so that the rays of
the sun penetrated through many openings,
and the beaten path which they pursued
was entirely exposed to the genial beams.
Groves of the wild apple, the plum, and the
cherry, now in full bloom, added a rich
beauty to the scene and a delightful fragrance
to the air.</p>

<p>But the greatest natural curiosity and the
most attractive scenic exhibitions of our
Western hemisphere was still in reserve;
and a spontaneous expression of wonder
and delight burst from the whole party, as
they emerged from the woods and stood on
the edge of <i>a prairie</i>. They entered a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
long vista, carpeted with grass, interspersed
with numberless flowers, among which the
blue violet predominated; while the edges
of the forest on either hand were elegantly
fringed with low thickets loaded with blossoms&mdash;those
of the plum and cherry of
snowy whiteness, and those of the crab-apple
of a delicate pink. Above and
beyond these were seen the rich green, the
irregular outline, and the variegated light
and shade of the forest. As if to produce
the most beautiful perspective, and to afford
every variety of aspect, the vista increased
in width until it opened like the estuary of
a great river into the broad prairie, and as
our travellers advanced the woodlands
receded on either hand, and sometimes
indented by smaller avenues opening into
the woods, and sometimes throwing out
points of timber, so that the boundary of
the plain resembled the irregular outline of
a shore as traced on a map.</p>

<span class="caption">Pioneer View of Houses at Fort Cumberland, Maryland</span>
</div>

<p>Delighted with the lovely aspect of
Nature in these the most tasteful of her
retreats, the party lingered along until they
reached the margin of the broad prairie,
where a noble expanse of scenery of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
same character was spread out on a larger
scale. They stood on a rising ground, and
beheld before them a vast plain, undulating
in its surface so as to present to the eye a
series of swells and depressions, never
broken nor abrupt, but always regular,
and marked by curved lines. Here and
there was seen a deep ravine or drain, by
which the superfluous water was carried
off, the sides of which were thickly set with
willows. Clumps of elm and oak were
scattered about far apart like little islands;
a few solitary trees were seen, relieving
the eye as it wandered over the ocean-like
surface of this native meadow.</p>

<p>It so happened that a variety of accidents
and delays impeded the progress of our
emigrants, so that the shadows of evening
began to fall upon them, while they were
yet far from the termination of their journey,
and it became necessary again to seek
a place of repose for the night. The prospect
of encamping again had lost much of
its terrors, but they were relieved from the
contemplation of this last resource of the
houseless, by the agreeable information
that they were drawing near the house of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
a farmer who was in the habit of &ldquo;accommodating
travellers.&rdquo; It was further explained
that Mr. Goodman did not keep a
public-house, but that he was &ldquo;well off,&rdquo;
&ldquo;had houseroom enough, and plenty to
eat,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<i>of course</i>,&rdquo; according to
the hospitable customs of the country, he
entertained any strangers who sought shelter
under his roof. Thither they bent their
steps, anticipating from the description of
it a homestead much larger and more comfortable
than the cheerless-looking log-cabins
which had thus far greeted their
eyes, and which seemed to compose the
only dwellings of the population.</p>

<p>On arriving at the place, they were a
little disappointed to find that the abundance
of <i>houseroom</i> which had been promised
them was a mere figure of speech, an
idiomatic expression by a native, having
a comparative signification. The dwelling
was a log house, differing from others only
in being of a larger size and better construction.
The logs were hewed and
squared instead of being put up in their
original state, with the bark on; the apertures
were carefully closed, and the open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>ings
representing windows, instead of
being stopped when urgent occasion required
the exclusion of the atmosphere, by
hats, old baskets, or cast-off garments, were
filled with glass, in imitation of the dwellings
of more highly civilized lands. The
wealth of this farmer, consisting chiefly of
the <i>plenty to eat</i> which had been boasted,
was amply illustrated by the noisy and
numerous crowd of chickens, ducks,
turkeys, pigs, and cattle, that cackled,
gobbled, and grunted about the house,
filling the air with social though discordant
sounds, and so obstructing the way as
scarcely to leave room for the newly-arrived
party to approach the door.</p>

<p>As the cavalcade halted, the foremost
driver made the fact known by a vociferous
salutation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hal-low! Who keeps house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A portly dame made her appearance at
the door, and was saluted with,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How de do, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;all well, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right well, thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some strangers that wants lodging;
can we get to stay all night with
you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know; <i>he&rsquo;s</i> not at home,
and I harly know what to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer for <i>him</i>,&rdquo; replied the driver,
who understood distinctly that the pronoun
used so emphatically by the good lady
alluded to her inferior moiety; &ldquo;he
wouldn&rsquo;t turn away strangers at this time
of day when the chickens is jist goin to
roost. We&rsquo;ve ben a travellin all day, and
our critters is mighty tired and hungry, as
well as the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the woman, very cheerfully,
&ldquo;I reckon you can stay; if you can
put up with such fare as we have, you are
very welcome. My man will be back soon;
he&rsquo;s only jist gone up to town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole party were now received into
the dwelling of the backwoodsman by the
smiling and voluble hostess, whose assiduous
cordiality placed them at once at their
ease in spite of the plain and primitive, and
to them uncomfortable aspect of the log
house. Indeed, nothing could be more
uninviting in appearance to those who
were accustomed only to the more convenient
dwellings of a state of society
farther advanced in the arts of social life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
It was composed of two large apartments
or separate cabins, connected by an area or
space which was floored and roofed, but
open at the sides, and which served as a
convenient receptacle to hang saddles,
bridles, and harness, or to stow travellers&rsquo;
baggage, while in fine weather it served as
a place in which to eat or sit.</p>

<p>In the room into which our party was
shown there was neither plastering nor
paper, nor any device of modern ingenuity
to conceal the bare logs that formed the
sides of the house, neither was there a
carpet on the floor, nor any furniture for
mere ornament. The absence of all superfluities
and of many of the conveniences
usually deemed essential in household
economy was quite striking. A table, a
few chairs, a small looking-glass, some
cooking utensils, and a multitudinous array
of women&rsquo;s apparel, hung round on wooden
pins, as if for show, made up the meagre
list, whether for parade or use, with the
addition of several bedsteads closely ranged
on one side of the room, supporting beds
of the most plethoric and dropsical dimensions,
covered with clean cotton bedding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and ostentatiously tricked out with gaudy,
parti-colored quilts.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;man&rdquo; soon made his appearance,
a stout, weatherbeaten person, of rough
exterior, but not less hospitably disposed
than his better half, and the whole household
were now actively astir to furnish
forth the evening&rsquo;s repast, nor was their
diligent kindness, nor the inquisitive though
respectful cross-examination which accompanied
it, at all diminished when they discovered
that their guests were English
people. Soon the ample fire-place, extending
almost across one end of the house, was
piled full of blazing logs; the cries of
affrighted fowls and other significant notes
of preparation announced that active operations
were commenced in the culinary department.
An array of pots and kettles,
skillets, ovens, and frying-pans, covered
the hearth, and the astonished travellers
discovered that the room they occupied was
not only used as a bedchamber, but
&ldquo;served them for parlour, and kitchen,
and hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We shall not attempt to describe the
processes of making bread, cooking meat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and vegetables, and preparing the delightful
beverage of the evening meal, a portion
of which took place in the presence of the
surprised and amused guests, while other
parts were conducted under a shed out of
doors. A large table was soon spread with
clean linen, and covered with a profusion
of viands such as probably could not be
found on the board of the mere peasant or
labouring farmer in any other part of the
world.<a name="FNanchor_48_50" id="FNanchor_48_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_50" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Coffee was there, with sweet milk
and buttermilk in abundance; fried
chickens, venison, and ham: cheese, sweetmeats,
pickles, dried fruit, and honey;
bread of wheat and corn, hot biscuits and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
cakes, with fresh butter; all well prepared
and neat, and all pressed upon the hungry
travellers with officious hospitality. Had
the entertainment been furnished in regal
style at some enchanted castle by invisible
hands, the guests could scarcely have been
more surprised by the profusion and
variety of the backwoods repast, so far did
the result produced exceed the apparent
means afforded by the desolate-looking and
scantily-furnished cabin.</p>

<p>If our worthy travellers were surprised
by the novelties of backwoods <i>inn</i>-hospitality
which thus far had pressed upon
them, how much was their wonder increased
when the hour for retiring arrived,
and the landlady apologized for being
obliged to separate guests from their hosts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our family is so large,&rdquo; said the
woman, &ldquo;that we have to have two rooms.
I shall have to put all of you strangers into
a room by yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party were accordingly conducted
into the other apartment, which was
literally filled with arrangements for
sleeping, there being several bedsteads,
each of which was closely curtained with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
sheets, blankets, and coverlids hung around
it for the occasion, while the whole floor
was strewed with pallets. Here Mr.
Edgarton and his whole party, including
Logan and the teamsters, were expected to
sleep. A popular poet, in allusion to this
patriarchal custom, impertinently remarks,</p>

<p class="poem">
Some cavillers<br />
Object to sleep with fellow-travellers.<br />
</p>

<p>And on this occasion the objection was
uttered vehemently, the ladies declaring
that martyrdom in any shape would be
preferable to lodging thus like a drove of
cattle. Unreasonable as such scruples
might have seemed, they were so pertinaciously
adhered to on the one side, and
so obstinately resisted by the exceedingly
difficult nature of the case on the other,
that there is no knowing to what extremities
matters might have gone, had not a
compromise been effected by which Logan
and the wagon-drivers were transferred
into the room occupied by the farmer&rsquo;s
family, while the Edgartons, the sister,
the maid, the greyhound, the pug-dog, and
the parrot, remained sole occupants of the
apartment prepared for them.</p>

</p><p>
On &ldquo;ridges&rdquo; (line 3): &ldquo;What Mr. Weld [an English
traveler in America] says of the national necessity of
balancing or trimming the stage, in passing over some
of the wretched roads in America, is by no means exaggerated.
&lsquo;The driver frequently had to call to the passengers
in the stage to lean out of the carriage, first on
one side, then on the other, to prevent it from oversetting
in the deep ruts, with which the road abounds.
&ldquo;Now, gentlemen, to the right!&rdquo; upon which the passengers
all stretched their bodies half out of the carriage
to balance on that side. &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, to the left!&rdquo;
and so on.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Weld&rsquo;s Travels.</i>&rdquo;
</p><p>
On &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; (line 4): &ldquo;Before the stage can pass
one of these bridges the driver is obliged to stop and
arrange the loose planks, of which it is composed, in the
manner that best suits his ideas of safety, and as the
planks are again disturbed by the passing of the coach,
the next travelers who arrive have, of course, a new arrangement
to make. Mahomet, as Sale tells us, was at
some pains to imagine a precarious kind of bridge for the
entrance of paradise, in order to enhance the pleasures
of arrival. A Virginia bridge, I think, would have
answered his purpose completely.&rdquo;</p></div>

which was erected beside Braddock&rsquo;s old road,
near Frostburg, Maryland, during the Revolutionary
War. On the reverse side it bears the legend, &ldquo;Our
Countrys Rights We Will Defend.&rdquo; On the front these
words can be traced: &ldquo;[12 ?] Miles to Fort Cumberland
29 Miles to Capt Smith&rsquo;s Inn &amp; Bridge by Crossings.
[Smithfield, Pennsylvania] the Best Road to Redstone
Old Fort 64 M.&rdquo; The stone was once taken away for
building purposes and broken; the town authorities of
Frostburg ordered it to be cemented, returned and set
up on its old-time site.</p></div>

days, because of the buffalo trail into the interior, it
remained down through the earlier and later pioneer era
to the time of the building of the trunk railway lines.</p></div>

counter a wretched fabrication of some traveller, who
represents himself as dismounting at a Western house
of entertainment, and inquiring the price of a dinner.
The answer is, &ldquo;Well, stranger&mdash;with wheat bread and
chicken fixens, it would be fifty cents, but with corn
bread and common doins, twenty-five cents.&rdquo; The
slang here used is of the writer&rsquo;s own invention. No
one ever heard in the West of &ldquo;chicken fixens,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;common doins.&rdquo; On such occasions, the table is
spread with everything that the house affords, or with
whatever may be convenient, according to the means
and temper of the entertainers. A meal is a meal, and
the cost is the same, whether it be plentiful or otherwise.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hall.</span></p></div>
